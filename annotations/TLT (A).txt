#### IRT-Based Adaptive Hints to Scaffold Learning in Programming


0	Over the past few decades, many studies conducted in the field of learning science have described that scaffolding plays an important role in human learning.
0	To scaffold a learner efficiently, a teacher should predict how much support a learner must have to complete tasks and then decide the optimal degree of assistance to support the learner's development.
0	Nevertheless, it is difficult to ascertain the optimal degree of assistance for learner development.
1	For this study, it is assumed that optimal scaffolding is based on a probabilistic decision rule: Given a teacher's assistance to facilitate the learner development, an optimal probability exists for a learner to solve a task.
1	To ascertain that optimal probability, we developed a scaffolding system that provides adaptive hints to adjust the predictive probability of the learner's successful performance to the previously determined certain value, using a probabilistic model, i.e., item response theory (IRT).
1	Furthermore, using the scaffolding system, we compared learning performances by changing the predictive probability.
2	Results show that scaffolding to achieve 0.5 learner success probability provides the best performance.
2	Additionally, results demonstrate that a scaffolding system providing 0.5 probability decreases the number of hints (amount of support) automatically as a fading function according to the learner's growth capability.

#### Rewrite Rules for Debugging Student Programs in Programming Tutors


0	Data-driven intelligent tutoring systems learn to provide feedback based on past student behavior, reducing the effort required for their development.
0	A major obstacle to applying data-driven methods in the programming domain is the lack of meaningful observable actions for describing the students problem-solving process.
1	We propose rewrite rules as a language-independent formalization of programming actions in terms of code edits.
1	We describe a method for automatically extracting rewrite rules from students program-writing traces, and a method for debugging new programs using these rules.
1	We used these methods to automatically provide hints in a web application for learning programming.
2	In-class evaluation showed that students receiving automatic feedback solved problems faster and submitted fewer incorrect programs.
2	We believe that rewrite rules provide a good basis for further research into how humans write and debug programs.

#### A Framework for Analyzing and Evaluating Architectures and Control Strategies in Distributed Remote Laboratories


0	Remote Access Laboratories (RALs) have been used to develop experimental knowledge about practical engineering topics for a while.
0	Distributed remote laboratories aim to share experiment among institutions and individuals through a distributed architecture.
0	Experiments from diverse areas are combined as part of a larger system.
0	Multiple control strategies are used to integrate experiments in Remote Laboratory Management Systems (RLMSs).
1	This work defines two main categories to analyze the various implementations, white box and black box approaches.
0	Experiments can be on a spectrum between these two extremes, sharing properties of both.
0	When integrating an existing experiment into a new distributed RAL system, it is useful to evaluate the experiment with respect to its host or new RLMS for determining the best strategies to assimilate it.
1	This paper provides a framework for such evaluation based on a number of properties of experiments.
1	The proposed framework is called SHASS (Software, Hardware, Assessment, Support, and Share-ability) based on several factors such as the hardware used, the software to create the program, methods of sharing, user's support, and assessment of user's performance.
1	It can be used to evaluate quality and identify options for improvements within an experiment's existing RLMS as well.
2	Using this framework, a black box and white box approach are compared using two examples - federated and Peer-to-Peer RAL.
2	The evaluation focuses on technical capabilities and development possibilities.
2	A set of four experiments are also analysed to illustrate the utility of the framework in creating and improving experiments with respect to their RLMS.

#### Understanding Learning Resources Metadata for Primary and Secondary Education


0	Educational resources can be easily found on the Web.
0	Most search engines base their algorithms on a resource's text or popularity, requiring teachers to navigate the results until they find an appropriate resource.
0	This makes searching for resources a tedious and cumbersome task.
0	Specialized repositories contain resources that are annotated with metadata that aim to facilitate the discovery of quality resources.
0	Nevertheless, the abundance and variety of content make searching a complex task.
0	Recommender systems can assist teachers in finding the proper content by determining clusters of similar users and inferring users interest in a resource, assembling clusters of similar resources, or a mix of both.
0	Probabilistic model-based (PMB) techniques, on the other hand, make it possible to classify resources into more than one cluster with various degrees of probability.
1	In this paper, we used recommender systems and PMB techniques to analyze a dataset produced by primary and secondary level teachers over the course of four years and under natural conditions.
2	We found that a hybrid recommendation, the Collaborative Topic Regression (CTR) technique, performs better than other approaches despite the high sparseness of the dataset.
2	In addition, learning resources annotated with curriculum metadata had a positive impact on recommender's accuracy whereas free-text or other metadata negatively impacted the results.

#### The Effect of Different Features for Educational Computer-Based Competition Environments


0	Educational computer-based competition environments need to be designed with a set of features that enhance the learning process.
0	Although recently some frameworks for the design of educational computer-based systems (e.g., educational games) have been proposed, they do not focus on the details of the competition.
0	Therefore, the design of educational computer-based competition environments is still an open issue.
1	We propose the 4NESS framework for the design of such competition environments.
1	This framework classifies the competition features into four dimensions: easiness, fairness, awareness, and adaptiveness.
1	We designed the ISCARE educational computer-based competition environment implementing these four dimensions to evaluate and validate some included features for competition, and conducted experiments during three consecutive years.
2	Students considered the computer-based competition environment with the proposed features, including a modification of the Swiss system, to be very easy to use, fair for pairing students, moderately fair for calculating scores, with good awareness of their state during the competition and that of their peers, and with contents of appropriate level, especially for the group working with adaptive contents.
2	Adaptation of contents made students increase their learning gains in 0.5 sigmas during the competition.
2	Pairings were seen as with students of similar levels.
2	And final scores were moderately fair: while the order tends to be similar as compared to the results in the post-test, students grades with high performance tend to be lower in the competition environment.

#### Blending Digital and Face-to-Face Interaction Using a Co-Located Social Media App in Class


0	Improving face-to-face (f2f) interaction in large classrooms is a challenging task as student participation can be hard to initiate.
0	Thanks to the wide adoption of personal mobile devices, it is possible to blend digital and face-to-face interaction and integrate co-located social media applications in the classroom.
1	To better understand how such applications can interweave digital and f2f interaction, we performed a detailed analysis of real-world use cases of a particular co-located social media app: SpeakUp.
1	In a nutshell, SpeakUp allows the creation of temporary location-bound chat rooms that are accessible by nearby users who can post and rate messages anonymously.
2	We find that the use of co-located social media is associated with an increase in content-related interaction in the class.
2	Furthermore, it is associated with an increase in the perceived learning outcomes of students compared to a control group.
2	We further provide design guidelines to blend digital and f2f interaction using co-located social media in the classroom based on 11 case studies covering over 2,000 students.

#### DEDOS: An Authoring Toolkit to Create Educational Multimedia Activities for Multiple Devices


0	Information and Communication Technologies offer new possibilities for teachers to enhance their teaching methods.
0	The increasing use of personal computers, tablets, interactive whiteboards, or even multitouch tabletops in the classrooms seems to attract the interest of the students.
0	However, there are not many tools that allow teachers to create multimedia activities for all these technologies in an effortless way.
0	Most of current authoring tools either focus on creating content for only one device or they do not fully exploit the benefits of rich content for designing engaging educational activities.
1	In this paper, we present an authoring toolkit composed by two applications: DEDOS-Editor, which allow teachers to design their own learning activities, and DEDOS-Web, which allows the students to perform those activities adapting them to multiple devices.
2	To test both tools, we have performed two evaluations.
2	One with teachers to test the authoring tools and a second one with primary school students to test if the activities designed with this tool enhance their learning process.
2	Results show that DEDOS-Editor is an easy to learn authoring tool which helps teachers to complement their learning methods while DEDOS-Web is flexible enough to create several learning scenarios from just one set of activities, factors which lead to achieving positive learning outcomes.

#### Game of Blazons: Helping Teachers Conduct Learning Situations That Integrate Web Tools and Multiple Types of Augmented Reality


0	Several studies have explored how to help teachers carry out learning situations involving Augmented Reality (AR), a technology that has shown different affordances for learning.
0	However, these works tend to rely on specific types of AR, focus on particular types of spaces, and are generally disconnected from other technologies widely used in education, such as VLEs or Web 2.0 tools.
0	These constraints limit the possible range of activities that can be conducted and their integration into the existing classroom practice.
1	GLUEPS-AR is a system that can help overcome these limitations, aiding teachers in the creation and enactment of learning situations that may combine multiple types of AR with other common web tools.
1	This paper presents an evaluation study conducted on Game of Blazons, a learning situation carried out by two university teachers using GLUEPS-AR, and framed within two days of outdoor activities in a village in Spain.
2	The evaluation showed that GLUEPS-AR provided an affordable support to the participant teachers to integrate several activities that made use of multiple types of AR, common web tools, and augmented paper, into a unique learning situation.

#### MEBook: Multimedia Social Greetings Intervention for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders


0	Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that impairs the development of social and communication skills.
0	There is evidence that children with ASD prefer images of self over others[1] .
0	These studies may explain the effectiveness of video self-modeling (VSM), an evidence-based ASD intervention in which one learns by watching oneself on video performing a target behavior.
0	VSM content is difficult to create as target behaviors are sporadic.
1	In this paper, we propose the MEBook system which uses a Kinect sensor to inject self-images into a gesture-based social narrative to teach children with ASD proper greeting behaviors.
1	MEBook consists of two components.
1	The first component is a social narrative.
1	A social narrative is an animated story about the main character meeting and greeting different cartoon characters in a particular setting.
1	Self-modeling is achieved by first replacing the main characters face with an image of the learner, and then animating the learner's body and voice to match the narration.
1	The second component is a positive reinforcement practice session in which the subject is prompted to greet different cartoon characters.
1	Through depth-based body posture tracking, proper greeting behaviors are recognized and immediately reinforced with praise and visual confetti.
2	Novel computational multimedia tools are proposed to turn video recordings of successful attempts into VSM content, thereby alleviating the tedious production process.
2	A multiple-baseline single subject pilot study has been conducted and the preliminary results show that MEBook is potentially effective in teaching greeting behaviors to children with ASD.

1	This article describes the development of the Design Evaluation and Feedback Tool (DEFT), a custom-built web-based system that collects and reports data to support teaching, learning, and research in project-based engineering design education.
1	The DEFT system collects data through short weekly questionnaires for students and instructors in engineering design classes, and uses these data to produce weekly reports for both types of user.
1	The system is intended to engage students in reflective reporting on their experiential learning, to support educators in coaching student designers, and to serve as a data collection tool for education researchers.
1	DEFT was developed through an iterative design and evaluation process, involving 185 students and 18 instructors at two universities.
2	The system was evaluated using a combination of participation observation, user interviews, and anonymous questionnaires, and the results guided subsequent improvements to the system.

#### An Investigation of the Effects of Measuring Authentic Contexts on Geometry Learning Achievement


0	Geometry students have few opportunities to apply geometric concepts and solve geometry problems in authentic contexts.
0	We developed a Ubiquitous Geometry (UG) system to teach geometry to elementary students by using it to measure common objects in authentic contexts.
1	The instant study investigates the effects of UG on student geometry estimation ability, geometry learning achievement, spatial ability, and learning geometric concepts and explores the correlations.
1	Participants were 82 fifth grade students divided into the experiment group (EG), the ruler measurement group (RG), and the control group (CG).
2	The results revealed that the EG students performed significantly better than the others in geometry estimation ability, geometry learning achievement, spatial ability, and understanding geometric concepts.
2	We found that geometry estimation ability is significantly related to spatial ability and geometry learning achievement, which means fostering estimation ability through measuring authentic objects could help students to learn geometry.
2	Finally, students perceived that UG engaged them more in geometry and improved their interest in learning because the activity designs related more to their daily life, thereby enhancing their sense of confidence and satisfaction.
2	Conclusions include that UG effectively enhances student geometry estimation ability, geometry learning achievement, spatial ability, and understanding of geometric concepts.

#### Approaching Sustainability Learning Via Digital Serious Games


0	Finding proper ways to address learning about sustainability is a relevant issue.
0	Sustainability learning has to face some inherent complexities, due to two main factors: the interdisciplinary domains related to sustainability issues, such as ecology, economics, politics, and culture, and the involvement of several social structures, such as individuals, families, and communities.
0	One recent research proposal is to exploit serious games to foster learning in this area.
0	This resulted in a significant increase in the number of approaches discussed in the literature over the last few years.
0	Notwithstanding this growing scenario, sustainability serious games still lack a reasoned evaluation, in order to clarify their possible applications and to define effective design strategies to approach them.
0	To this end, in this paper, we investigate the current state of the art of serious games for sustainability, identifying, and discussing the most common applications.
0	The research process included both scientific publications and unpublished materials.
1	References were searched according to guiding questions, which helped focus the extraction of information, and through recursive browsing of their citations.
1	Based on the research results, we propose a taxonomy for sustainability serious games and a classification of reviewed works according to this taxonomy.
2	We also analyze design strategies, drawn from the literature, expressly conceived for the development of effective sustainability serious games.
2	Finally, we discuss the current challenges and present possible areas of research in this field.

0	Information about the nature and level of student engagement with these activities can help instructors make informed decisions regarding how to best support student learning.
0	Despite the comprehensive data collection enabled by the increasing presence of education technologies, few studies have used these data to investigate the range of strategies students employ in FC models.
0	This study addresses this deficit by proposing an analytical approach that allows for exploring, first, the strategies students use to interact with online preparation activities; and, second, evolution of those strategies over the duration of a course delivered with a FC pedagogy.

1	While learners practice on a tablet real-time data indicating learner progress and performance is displayed on teacher dashboards.
1	This study examines how teachers use the dashboards, applying Verberts’ learning analytics process model.
1	Teacher dashboard consultations and resulting pedagogical actions were observed in 38 mathematics lessons.
1	In stimulated recall interviews, the 38 teachers were asked to elaborate on how they reflect on and make sense of the information on the dashboard.
2	The results showed that teachers consulted the dashboard on average 8.3 times per lesson.
2	Teachers activated existing knowledge about students and the class to interpret dashboard information.
2	Task and process feedback were the pedagogical actions most often used following dashboard consultation.
2	Additionally, teachers who consulted the dashboard more often activated more and more diverse pedagogical knowledge to interpret the data and, consequently, gave more and more diverse feedback.
2	These results indicated that teacher dashboards were indeed influencing teachers’ pedagogical actions in their daily classroom activities.
2	This study provided the first evidence that dashboards progressively impact teaching practice and initiate more profound behavioral changes as teachers become more proficient in using them.

#### Persuasive Technologies in m-Learning for Training Professionals: How to Keep Learners Engaged With Adaptive Triggering


0	Global corporations are characterized by a large number of employees and geographically dispersed offices.
0	Moreover, the competitiveness in the global market requires them to invest in their human resources to be able to remain a step ahead of competition.
0	Implementing large scale classical education in such environments is challenging and costly.
0	Mobile e-learning (m-learning) allows users to tailor their professional training and education to their needs and time constraints.
0	However, in self-paced education, it is very hard to keep user retention and engagement.
1	To achieve the latter, we have designed and developed an m-learning platform for corporate environments based on the triggering persuasive technology principle that try to incite users in regularly using the platform.
1	We have evaluated the application in-the-wild in corporate environments of differently sized companies with 300 users.
1	Users were subjected to three different conditions: no triggering, simple regular triggering, and adaptive triggering.

#### User-Centric Evaluation of Recommender Systems in Social Learning Platforms: Accuracy is Just the Tip of the Iceberg


0	Recommender systems provide users with content they might be interested in.
0	Conventionally, recommender systems are evaluated mostly by using prediction accuracy metrics only.
0	But, the ultimate goal of a recommender system is to increase user satisfaction.
0	Therefore, evaluations that measure user satisfaction should also be performed before deploying a recommender system in a real target environment.
0	Such evaluations are laborious and complicated compared to the traditional, data-centric evaluations, though.
1	In this study, we carried out a user-centric evaluation of state-of-the-art recommender systems as well as a graph-based approach in the ecologically valid setting of an authentic social learning platform.
1	We also conducted a data-centric evaluation on the same data to investigate the added value of user-centric evaluations and how user satisfaction of a recommender system is related to its performance in terms of accuracy metrics.
2	Our findings suggest that user-centric evaluation results are not necessarily in line with data-centric evaluation results.
2	We conclude that the traditional evaluation of recommender systems in terms of prediction accuracy only does not suffice to judge performance of recommender systems on the user side.
2	Moreover, the user-centric evaluation provides valuable insights in how candidate algorithms perform on each of the five quality metrics for recommendations: usefulness, accuracy, novelty, diversity, and serendipity.

1	VisEN provides explorable visual narratives personalized to students in order to support them in engaging with course content.
1	The evaluation of VisEN showed that the explorable visual narratives encouraged the majority of `improving engagement students', that completed the Information Management and Data Engineering module as part of their undergraduate degree, to engage with assigned activities, and subsequently these learners enhanced their engagement levels.
2	Visualizations have been used in OLEs to support students by presenting student data.
2	Information Visualization research has demonstrated the value of visual narratives in communicating a message, by highlighting facts and making the message more memorable.
2	In addition, visual data exploration can support users in understandings the message.

1	After a knowledge test, the groups were to form collaborative learning dyads.
1	Based on the test, a novel knowledge discrepancy calculation tool discerned group configurations with maximal and minimal discrepancies in knowledge between potential learning partners.
1	In the experimental condition, groups were made aware of the results of this calculation; in the control condition, groups were asked to form dyads absent any additional guidance.
2	The significant majority of groups in the experimental condition formed dyads with maximal knowledge discrepancy between partners.
2	The majority of groups in the control condition formed dyads based on factors unrelated to learning.
2	We anticipated that in dyads with discrepant knowledge, partners will be better able to fill each other's knowledge gaps.
2	Although a significant difference between conditions did not transpire, there was a significant correlation between knowledge discrepancy and learning gain across conditions.
2	The implications of these findings for effective learning group organization are discussed; implementation of the calculation tool in classrooms and MOOCs is proposed.

#### CCESK: A Chinese Character Educational System Based on Kinect


1	In this paper, a Chinese character educational system based on Kinect is proposed for guiding beginners to learn the basics of Chinese characters in a more intuitive way.
1	It extracts 19 common components, denoted as alphabets, from Chinese characters.
1	Nineteen postures were designed according to the shapes of these alphabets.
1	Instead of memorizing Chinese characters through repetitive copying, students can first associate an alphabet with the corresponding designed posture.
1	Then, they break down a Chinese character into a set of alphabets in order to perform the sequence of corresponding postures so that they can easily remember the whole character.
1	Our proposed system contains two major functions: (1) the learning function that is responsible for delivering the courseware, and (2) the testing function that is used to let students acquire their learning progress through some tests.
1	A rule-based algorithm is designed to recognize the students' input postures captured from the Kinect motion sensor so as to determine whether the students have performed the correct postures.
1	We conducted a survey which involved 90 students to try our proposed system as well as two other learning modes for comparison.
1	Moreover, we have interviewed those 30 students who had tried our proposed system with some open-ended questions.
2	The positive results show that the proposed system can promote students' experiences in learning Chinese characters.

#### Detecting Plagiarism Based on the Creation Process


0	All methodologies for detecting plagiarism to date have focused on the final digital “outcome”, such as a document or source code.
0	Our novel approach takes the creation process into account using logged events collected by special software or by the macro recorders found in most office applications.
1	We look at an author's interaction logs with the software used to create the work.
1	Detection relies on comparing the histograms of multiple logs' command use.
1	A work is classified as plagiarism if its log deviates too much from logs of “honestly created” works or if its log is too similar to another log.
2	The technique supports the detection of plagiarism for digital outcomes that stem from unique tasks, such as theses and equal tasks such as assignments for which the same problem sets are solved by multiple students.
1	Focusing on the latter case, we evaluate this approach using logs collected by an interactive development environment (IDE) from more than 60 students who completed three programming assignments.

#### Predicting Students Disengaged Behaviors in an Online Meaning-Generation Task


0	In an intelligent tutoring system (ITS), it can be useful to know when a student has disengaged from a task and might benefit from a particular intervention.
0	However, predicting disengagement on a trial-by-trial basis is a challenging problem, particularly in complex cognitive domains.
1	In the present work, data-driven methods were used to address two aspects of this problem: identification of predictive features at the single-trial level, and selection of accurate and robust models.
1	Experiment data were collected in a middle-school classroom using a vocabulary training ITS.
1	On each trial, the ITS presented a low-frequency (Tier 2 or frontier) word and prompted students to type in the word's meaning.
1	Single-trial measures-including the orthographic and semantic accuracy of each response, and context-sensitive measures such as interaction patterns across trials-were computed throughout the task.
2	There were two key findings.
2	First, as expected, different features predicted when a student was likely to be more engaged (e.g., high semantic accuracy) or less engaged (e.g., repetition of same or similar words across consecutive trials).
2	Second, there was added value in representing context-sensitive information, which captures patterns of performance over time, as well as trial-specific information.
2	These findings provide useful insights into effective methods for representing and modeling temporal patterns of student engagement in an ITS, especially those related to language learning.
2	Such models may be useful in the design and implementation of adaptive tutors in complex cognitive domains like language learning.

0	This project aimed to improve students' learning and task performance using a non-cognitive learning companion in the context of both a tutor and a meta-tutor.
0	The tutor taught students how to construct models of dynamic systems and the meta-tutor taught students a learning strategy.
1	The non-cognitive learning companion was designed to increase students' effort and persistence in using the learning strategy.
1	It decided when to intervene and what to say using both log data and affective state monitoring via a facial expression camera and a posture sensor.
2	Experiments with high school students showed that the non-cognitive learning companion increased students' learning and performance.
2	However, it had no effect on performance during a transfer phase in which the learning companion, meta-tutor, and tutor were all absent.
2	The transfer phase null effect must be interpreted with caution due to low power, a possible floor effect, and other issues.

#### A Framework for Educational Technologies that Support Representational Competencies


0	Visual representations are ubiquitous in STEM disciplines.
0	Yet, students' difficulties in learning with visual representations are well documented.
0	Therefore, to succeed in STEM, students need representational competencies-the ability to use visual representations for problem solving and learning.
0	Educational technologies that support students' acquisition of representational competencies can significantly enhance their success in STEM disciplines.
0	Current design frameworks for educational technologies do not offer sufficient guidance to develop supports for representational competencies.
1	This paper presents a new design framework that describes an iterative, step-by-step approach for the design of educational technologies that support representational competencies (SUREC) in a way that aligns with the demands specific to the target discipline.

#### Towards New Multiplatform Hybrid Online Laboratory Models


0	Online laboratories have traditionally been split between virtual labs, with simulated components; and remote labs, with real components.
0	The former tend to provide less realism but to be easily scalable and less expensive to maintain, while the latter are fully real but tend to require a higher maintenance effort and be more error-prone.
1	This technical paper describes an architecture for hybrid labs merging the two approaches, in which virtual and real components interact with each other.
0	The goal is to leverage the advantages of each type of lab.
1	The architecture is fully web-based and multiplatform, which is in line with the industry and the remote laboratory community trends.
0	Only recently has this become technically feasible for graphic-intensive laboratories due to previous limitations in browser-based graphical technologies.
1	This architecture relies on the recent HTML5 and WebGL standards to overcome these limitations, and makes use of the Unity technology.
2	To ensure that the proposed architecture is suitable, we set requirements based on the literature, we compare it with other approaches, and we examine its scope, strengths, and weaknesses.

0	These are based on 3D Multi User Virtual Environment platforms (MUVE), and although they have been used for various innovative educational projects their complex permission systems and large numbers of functions can make their management potentially challenging.
0	It follows that an inadequately managed MULE can be ineffective with respect to intended learning outcomes.
0	The purpose of this research was to determine how management challenges manifest themselves and how to support educators in learning and applying MULE management skills.
1	We utilized the popular OpenSim platform for this study.
1	First, a survey of the need for user support (${\mathrm{N\,= \,43}}$) is described.
1	Next, the design and evaluation of a guidance tool using graph topologic visualization of OpenSim functions is presented (${\mathrm{N\,= \,211}}$).
1	The tool is further evaluated in the delivery of a course module.
1	The analysis and user feedback indicated that the tool provides accurate information and helpful support for MULE management.
1	As the final phase of the research, training environments were developed for both basic and advanced OpenSim MULE management.
2	Evaluations of their usability and perceived educational value were carried out with participants (${\mathrm{N\,= \,68}}$); the outcomes suggest that training for advanced MULE management is more useful for all users, without requiring more time or effort, regardless of the degree of complexity of the MULE being designed.

#### Impact of Using a Robot Patient for Nursing Skill Training in Patient Transfer


0	In the past few decades, simulation training has been used to help nurses improve their patient-transfer skills.
0	However, the effectiveness of such training remains limited because it lacks effective ways of simulating patients' actions realistically.
0	It is difficult for nurses to use the skills learned from simulation training to transfer an actual patient.
0	Therefore, we developed a robot patient that could simulate the behavior of patients' limbs for patient-transfer training.
1	This study examined the performance of the robot used in training and evaluated its training effectiveness.
1	Four nursing teachers individually transferred the robot patient and then scored the robot patient's ability to simulate patients' actions and its suitability for skill training.
1	An experiment using pre-post control group design was carried out to examine the robot patient's training effectiveness compared with the human simulated patient.
1	The participants were 20 nursing students and one nursing teacher who was responsible for scoring the students' skills in the pre-test and post-test.
1	All of the students were assigned to train with either the proposed robot patient or a healthy person simulating the patient.
2	The results show that all four nursing teachers regarded the robot patient's actions as realistic.
2	In addition, all four teachers agreed that the robot patient was suitable for skill training.
2	The results also show that the proposed robot patient is more challenging than the current method, which employs a healthy person to simulate the patient.
2	Significant skill improvement (p <; 0.01) was observed in the experimental group when transferring the robot patient.

#### Needles in the Haystack: Finding Content Worth Preparing for Workplace Learning with the KEP Model


0	Knowledge transfer between employees is a primary concern in organizations.
0	Employees create or acquire content that partially represents knowledge.
0	  These knowledge elements are specific to the context in and for which they are created and rarely address the learning needs of other employees in other work situations.
0	Organizations therefore need to support the preparation of knowledge elements to facilitate knowledge transfer, but often have limited resources to process a plethora of content.
1	This paper presents the Knowledge Element Preparation (KEP) model that helps to structure the complex decision to select knowledge elements worthy of preparation out of ample available content and assign them to preparation tasks.
1	The model combines the benefits of prepared knowledge elements in workplace learning, which we identified in an ethnographically informed study of a software development company, with efforts discussed in the literature.
1	We implemented and reflected on the model in a case study of a research and development project.
2	Our findings suggest that we can estimate the benefits of adaptively delivered content based on the importance of topics, types of knowledge elements, and preparation tasks.
2	We also contribute personas, dimensions of knowledge elements, and knowledge work situations as instruments to facilitate the instantiation of the KEP model.

#### Teaching with a Dual-Channel Classroom Feedback System in the Digital Classroom Environment


0	Teaching with a classroom feedback system can benefit both teaching and learning practices of interactivity.
1	In this paper, we propose a dual-channel classroom feedback system integrated with a back-end e-Learning system.
1	The system consists of learning agents running on the students' computers and a teaching agent running on the instructor's computer.
1	The learning agent collects both instructional and social responses from the students and then sends them back to the instructor's computer through a two-channel mechanism.
1	The instructional responses are obtained by recognizing the spoken keywords; while the social responses are obtained by analyzing the social signals provided by students' head movements.
1	Later, the teaching agent displays the summarized responses on the teaching dashboard for the instructor to evaluate their teaching practices.
2	Empirical experiment results show that the system has an acceptable performance and provides enhanced interactivity in both learning and teaching.
2	Also, further analysis reveals that the dual-channel mechanism not only provides the basic functions of a classroom feedback system, the student's responses to the instructor's questions, but also promotes both students and instructors to be engaged and attentive in class.
2	As the two-channel feedback mechanism can be embedded into an e-Learning system, the proposed system is an enhancement of a digital classroom environment.
2	In short, with the help of the two-channel feedback mechanism, interactivity on teaching practices and learning activities can be greatly improved.
2	Students can then acquire a much better learning experience and satisfaction.

0	For example, students learned about signs and rules in class and then applied this new knowledge to create their own rules for a location in their community (e.g., playground rules that tell visitors what is or is not allowed to do in a local playground) to make it more environmentally friendly.
0	To facilitate this, we developed a mobile learning system equipped with a dictionary as well as textual annotation, recording, and sharing functions.
1	This mobile learning system enables students to take pictures of objects, describe them verbally or in writing, and share their work with peers.
1	Our goal was to study the effectiveness of learning activities supported by a mobile learning system on the cognitive learning process by examining the changes in students' cognitive processes and the distribution of students who reach a certain level of cognition before and after learning.
1	Fifty-seven junior high school students participated in the research, and their views of the mobile learning system and interest in continuing use were also explored.
1	Students were divided into one control (n = 26) group and one experimental (n = 31) group.
1	The control group completed learning activities using a traditional approach while the experimental group used a learning system installed in tablet PCs.
1	The effectiveness of the mobile PC system on students' cognitive processes was tested by comparing the control and experimental groups' pre-test and post-test outcomes.
1	Changes in students' cognitive processes were measured by calculating the differences in student scores among three tasks.
1	The distribution of students who reached a certain level of cognition was derived based on their learning performance.
1	Students' perceptions were evaluated using a questionnaire survey.
1	The mobile learning system kept records of how students used it.
2	Our results show that the experimental students significantly outperformed the control students on test items related to high cognitive levels.
2	Students made clear cognitive progress from the second topic to the third one.
2	Most students rated the learning system highly and want to use it in the future.
2	Finally, the results show that creating text annotations is the best indicator of learning.
2	Based on these results, we recommend applying appropriate learning activities supported by a mobile learning system to facilitate students' cognitive processes when they are studying English as a foreign language in an authentic environment.

1	We describe the problem that this architecture deals with as “tool orchestration” in collaborative learning settings.
1	This term refers to a situation where data relevant to a collaborative learning activity need to be forwarded to and processed by various learning technological tools (e.g. a forum, a pedagogical agent, a service or a software component that provides a specific functionality, etc.), in order for the collaborative activity to be efficiently represented and teachers' pedagogical level decisions implemented.
1	To facilitate data-transfer among the various tools and accomplish flexible interventions during runtime, the architecture employs a key component (“mediator component”) which makes use of an IMS-LD based representation of the activity.
2	By implementing the architecture tradeoff analysis method in three case studies, evaluation data regarding the proposed architecture have been recorded and are presented in this paper.
2	Targeted stakeholders (learners, teachers, and developers) provided valuable insights on the capacity of the architecture to efficiently facilitate tool orchestration during the realization of a flexible IMS-LD based course.

#### CMX: The Effects of an Educational MMORPG on Learning and Teaching Computer Programming


0	Computer programming has for decades posed several difficulties for students of all educational levels.
0	A number of teaching approaches have been proposed over the years but none seems to fulfil the needs of students nowadays.
0	Students use computers mainly for playing games and the Internet and as quite a few researchers state this aspect of computers should be taken into account in the way we educate them.
1	Towards this direction, this paper aims to examine the effects of using an educational Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG) on teaching and learning computer programming.
1	The educational features of an MMORPG called CMX are presented along with a design framework that was devised taking into account previous work in designing educational games.
1	The effects of CMX on teaching and learning computer programming are assessed through a study with first-year undergraduate students.
1	Seventy six students used CMX over a period of five weeks for learning various procedural programming concepts.
1	Students evaluated various aspects of CMX byfilling in a questionnaire that was based on an evaluation framework, which was devised in accordance with the design framework of CMX.
1	Moreover, the results of a midterm exam that took place priorto using CMX and students' accomplishments in the context of CMX were recorded and analyzed.
2	The results show that the majority of the students was entertained by playing the game while learning, and felt motivated to continue based on the game's scenario due to the variety of activities included.
2	In regards to the students' performance, a pre-test and a post-test were carried out in the experimental group, i.e., the participants of this study, and the control group, i.e., students of the course that continued to get taught the same concepts and performed the same assignments as the experimental group, but traditionally.
2	The pre-test and post-test analysis of the performance results for both groups showed that the majority of the students in the experimental group increased their performance in computer programming.
2	Furthermore, students stated they had a positive attitude in regards to re-using CMX in the future in order to learn additional programming concepts.
2	The positive results of this study pave the way for CMX being used in the classroom and expanding the game's functionalities that will further increase students' performance and support teachers in delivering the required knowledge.

#### Investigating the Impact of Gaming Habits, Gender, and Age on the Effectiveness of an Educational Video Game: An Exploratory Study


1	This study examines the influence of players' age, gender, and gaming preferences and habits (from now on, “gaming preferences”) on the effectiveness of a specific videogame that has been designed to increase the interest towards classical theater among teenagers.
1	Using a validated instrument, participants were divided into four groups based on their gaming preferences: (1) Well-rounded (WR) gamers, who play all types of games often; (2) Hardcore players, who frequently tend to play first-person shooter (FPS) and sports games; (3) Casual players, who play moderately and tend to play music, social, and puzzle games; and (4) Non-gamers, who barely play videogames at all.
2	Among all of the participants' personal factors (age, gender, and type of player) that were measured, only gaming preferences seemed to have a significant (p<;.05) positive influence on students' interest in theater-going.
2	Neither age nor gender seemed to affect the outcomes.
2	Casual and Well-rounded gamers scored higher in the game than Non-gamers and Hardcore players.
1	Due to these results, we also explored whether the gaming profile affected traditional educational approaches.
2	Traditional education worked better than videogames only for students who do not usually play videogames.
2	This study suggests that gaming preferences may influence the effectiveness of different educational approaches.
2	Knowing students' gaming preferences in advance may help educators find the best educational approach for each student.

#### A Fuzzy Group Decision Making Model for Ordinal Peer Assessment


0	Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are becoming an increasingly popular choice for education but, to reach their full extent, they require the resolution of new issues like assessing students at scale.
0	A feasible approach to tackle this problem is peer assessment, in which students also play the role of assessor for assignments submitted by others.
0	Unfortunately, students are unreliable graders so peer assessment often does not deliver accurate results.
1	In order to mitigate this issue, we propose a new model for ordinal peer assessment based on the principles of fuzzy group decision making.
1	In our approach, each student is asked to rank a few random submissions from the best to the worst and to specify, with a set of intuitive labels, at what extent each submission is better than the following one in the ranking.
1	Students' provided rankings are then transformed in fuzzy preference relations, expanded to estimate missing values and aggregated through OWA operators.
1	The aggregated relation is then used to generate a global ranking between the submissions and to estimate their absolute grades.
2	Experimental results are presented and show better performances with respect to other existing ordinal and cardinal peer assessment techniques both in the reconstruction of the correct ranking and on the estimation of students' grades.

#### Towards Actionable Learning Analytics Using Dispositions


0	Studies in the field of learning analytics (LA) have shown students' demographics and learning management system (LMS) data to be effective identifiers of “at risk” performance.
0	However, insights generated by these predictive models may not be suitable for pedagogically informed interventions due to the inability to explain why students display these behavioral patterns.
0	Therefore, this study aims at providing explanations of students' behaviors on LMS by incorporating dispositional dimensions (e.g., self-regulation and emotions) into conventional learning analytics models.
0	Using a combination of demographic, trace, and self-reported data of eight contemporary social-cognitive theories of education from 1,069 students in a blended introductory quantitative course, we demonstrate the potential of dispositional characteristics of students, such as procrastination and boredom.
2	Our results highlight the need to move beyond simple engagement metrics, whereby dispositional learning analytics provide an actionable bridge between learning analytics and educational intervention.

#### Predicting Student Performance from LMS Data: A Comparison of 17 Blended Courses Using Moodle LMS


0	With the adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) in educational institutions, a lot of data has become available describing students' online behavior.
0	Many researchers have used these data to predict student performance.
0	This has led to a rather diverse set of findings, possibly related to the diversity in courses and predictor variables extracted from the LMS, which makes it hard to draw general conclusions about the mechanisms underlying student performance.
1	We first provide an overview of the theoretical arguments used in learning analytics research and the typical predictors that have been used in recent studies.
1	We then analyze 17 blended courses with 4,989 students in a single institution using Moodle LMS, in which we predict student performance from LMS predictor variables as used in the literature and from in-between assessment grades, using both multi-level and standard regressions.
2	Our analyses show that the results of predictive modeling, notwithstanding the fact that they are collected within a single institution, strongly vary across courses.
2	Thus, the portability of the prediction models across courses is low.
2	In addition, we show that for the purpose of early intervention or when in-between assessment grades are taken into account, LMS data are of little (additional) value.
2	We outline the implications of our findings and emphasize the need to include more specific theoretical argumentation and additional data sources other than just the LMS data.

#### Am I Performing Well at All?


0	In collaborative learning environments, students work together on assignments in virtual teams and depend on each other's contribution to achieve their learning objectives.
0	The online learning environment, however, may not only facilitate but also hamper group communication, coordination, and collaboration.
0	Group awareness widgets that visualize information about the different group members based on information collected from the individuals can foster awareness and reflection processes within the group.
1	In this paper, we present a formative data study about the predictive power of several indicators of an awareness widget based on automatically logged user data from an online learning environment.
1	In order to test whether the information visualized by the widget is in line with the study outcomes, we instantiated the widget indicators with data from four previous runs of the European Virtual Seminar on Sustainable Development (EVS).
1	We analyzed whether the tutor gradings in these previous years correlated with the students' scores calculated for the widget indicators.
1	Furthermore, we tested the predictive power of the widget indicators at various points in time with respect to the final grades of the students.
2	The results of our analysis show that the grades and widget indicator scores are significantly and positively correlated, which provides a useful empirical basis for the development of guidelines for students and tutors on how to interpret the widget's visualizations in live runs.

#### A Novel Web-Based Approach for Visualization and Inspection of Reading Difficulties on University Students


0	Existing tools aim to detect university students with early diagnosis of dyslexia or reading difficulties, but there are not developed tools that let those students better understand some aspects of their difficulties.
0	In this paper, a dashboard for visualizing and inspecting early detected reading difficulties and their characteristics, called PADA (acronym for the Spanish name Panel de Analíticas de Aprendizaje de Dislexia en Adultos), is presented.
1	PADA is a web-based tool designed to facilitate the creation of descriptive visualizations required for a better understanding by students about their learner model.
1	Through information visualization techniques, PADA shows students the knowledge in their learner models in order to help them to increase their awareness and to support reflection and self-regulation about their difficulties in reading.
1	PADA provides different learning analytics on reading performance of students, so that they can self-identify their strengths and weaknesses and self-regulate their learning.
1	This paper describes examples that cover a variety of visualizations (bar-charts, line-charts, and pie-charts) to show user model fragments as personal details, reading profiles, learning styles, and cognitive traits of the students.
1	We tested PADA with 26 students (aged 21-53 years) of different academic programs and levels, dyslexic and non-dyslexic.
2	The results show that PADA can assist students in creating awareness, and help them to understand their difficulties associated with the reading tasks, as well as facilitate reflection and self-regulation in the learning process.
2	Implications for the design of learning analytics are discussed and directions for future work are outlined.

#### Privacy-Preserving Learning Analytics: Challenges and Techniques


0	Educational data contains valuable information that can be harvested through learning analytics to provide new insights for a better education system.
0	However, sharing or analysis of this data introduce privacy risks for the data subjects, mostly students.
0	Existing work in the learning analytics literature identifies the need for privacy and pose interesting research directions, but fails to apply state of the art privacy protection methods with quantifiable and mathematically rigorous privacy guarantees.
1	This work aims to employ and evaluate such methods on learning analytics by approaching the problem from two perspectives: (1) the data is anonymized and then shared with a learning analytics expert, and (2) the learning analytics expert is given a privacy-preserving interface that governs her access to the data.
1	We develop proof-of-concept implementations of privacy preserving learning analytics tasks using both perspectives and run them on real and synthetic datasets.
2	We also present an experimental study on the trade-off between individuals' privacy and the accuracy of the learning analytics tasks.

#### Combining University Student Self-Regulated Learning Indicators and Engagement with Online Learning Events to Predict Academic Performance


0	Self-regulated learning theories are used to understand the reasons for different levels of university student academic performance.
0	Similarly, learning analytics research proposes the combination of detailed data traces derived from technology-mediated tasks with a variety of algorithms to predict student academic performance.
0	The former approach is designed to provide meaningful pedagogical guidance, while the latter is designed to identify event patterns and relations that can be translated into actionable remediation.
0	The benefits of both approaches have motivated this study to investigate if a combination of the self-report data and data arising from an observation of the engagement of students with online learning events offers a deeper understanding and explanation of why some students achieve relatively higher levels of academic performance.
1	In this paper we explore how to combine data about self-regulated learning skills with observable measures of online activity in a blended learning course to increase predictive capabilities of student academic performance for the purposes of informing teaching and task design.
1	A case study in a course with 145 students showed that the variation of the students' final score for their course is better explained when factors from both approaches are considered.
2	The results point to the potential of adopting a combined use of self-report and observed data to gain a more comprehensive understanding of successful university student learning.

#### Contextual Markup and Mining in Digital Games for Science Learning: Connecting Player Behaviors to Learning Goals


0	Digital games can make unique and powerful contributions to K-12 science education, but much of that potential remains unrealized.
0	Research evaluating games for learning still relies primarily on pre- and post-test data, which limits possible insights into more complex interactions between game design features, gameplay, and formal assessment.
0	Therefore, a critical step forward involves developing rich representations for analyzing gameplay data.
1	This paper leverages data mining techniques to model learning and performance, using a metadata markup language that relates game actions to concepts relevant to specific game contexts.
1	We discuss results from a classroom study and identify potential relationships between students' planning/prediction behaviors observed across game levels and improvement on formal assessments.
2	The results have implications for scaffolding specific activities, that include physics learning during gameplay, solution planning and effect prediction.
2	Overall, the approach underscores the value of our contextualized approach to gameplay markup to facilitate data mining and discovery.

1	This study combined a context-aware mechanism, which can be used to provide suitable learning information anytime and anyplace by using GPS technology, with a rapid and user-friendly QR code interface input into a personalized context-aware recommendation (PCAR) learning system for enabling learners to immediately save useful external contents as learning materials.
1	To improve students' English application abilities efficiently, GPS combined with an intelligent personalized context-aware learning algorithm was used to obtain English learning content that is more practical.
2	The results of several experiments and investigations indicate that the posttest grades of the experimental group, which used the proposed PCAR system, were higher than those of the control group.
2	Furthermore, approximately 80 percent of the users were satisfied with how the system benefited their learning and with its ease of use.

#### Near Real-Time Comprehension Classification with Artificial Neural Networks: Decoding e-Learner Non-Verbal Behavior


0	Comprehension is an important cognitive state for learning.
0	Human tutors recognize comprehension and non-comprehension states by interpreting learner non-verbal behavior (NVB).
0	Experienced tutors adapt pedagogy, materials, and instruction to provide additional learning scaffold in the context of perceived learner comprehension.

0	Identifying such contexts by hand for a large number of words can be difficult.
1	In this work, we take a statistical learning approach to engineer a system that predicts informativeness of a context for target words that span the range of difficulty from middle school to college level.

1	Our training data included each context rated by 10 individuals on a four-point informativeness scale.
1	We process the text of each context into a novel collection of approximately 600 numerical features that captures diverse linguistic information.
1	We then fit a nonparametric regression model using Random Forests and compute out-of-sample prediction performance using cross-validation.
2	Our system performs well enough that it can replace a human judge: for a target word not found in our dataset, we can provide curated contexts to a student learner such that most of the contexts (54 percent) feature rich contextual clues and confusing contexts are rare ( <; 1 percent).

2	The solution is based on automatic analysis of multimedia lecture materials, such as speeches, transcripts, and slides, in order to facilitate the online learners in this era of e-learning - especially with MOOCs.
2	Sentence-level lecture highlighting basically uses acoustic features from the audio and the output is implemented in subtitle files of corresponding MOOC videos.
2	In comparison with ground truth created by experts, the precision is over 60 percent, which is better than baseline works and also welcomed by user feedbacks.
2	On the other hand, segment-level lecture highlighting works with statistical analysis, mainly by exploring the speech transcripts, the lecture slides and their connections.

0	Some emotions can get in the way of students performing their best (e.g., anxiety, frustration), whereas other emotions can facilitate student performance (e.g., engagement).
0	Many new, non-traditional assessments, such as automated conversation-based assessments (CBA), are designed with the intention to create a test-taking experience that maximizes beneficial emotions for students and minimizes detrimental emotions.
0	However, there is a paucity of research on students' actual emotional experiences during these non-traditional assessments.
1	Across two studies, we investigated students' moment-to-moment emotions during two CBAs that differed on construct (science inquiry, mathematical reasoning) and environment (virtual world, chat box).
1	We found a similar set of emotions to frequently occur across the two studies and came to the preliminary conclusion that students have a generally positive experience with CBAs and that boredom, confusion, curiosity, delight, engagement/flow, frustration, happiness/enjoyment, hope, and pride are the prevalent emotions in CBAs.
1	The temporal dynamics of emotions as well as the emotion-performance relationship were also investigated across the two studies.
1	Lastly, we discuss how these findings can inform the development of emotion-sensitive CBAs that can facilitate students being able to perform to the best of their ability.

#### Let's Set Up Some Subgoals: Understanding Human-Pedagogical Agent Collaborations and Their Implications for Learning and Prompt and Feedback Compliance


0	Research on collaborative learning between humans and virtual pedagogical agents represents a necessary extension to recent research on the conceptual, theoretical, methodological, analytical, and educational issues behind co-and socially-shared regulated learning between humans.
1	This study presents a novel coding framework that was developed and used to describe collaborations between learners and a pedagogical agent (PA) during a subgoal setting activity with MetaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system.
1	Learner-PA interactions were examined across two scaffolding conditions: prompt and feedback (PF), and control.
1	Learners' compliance to follow the PA's prompts and feedback in the PF condition were also examined.
2	Results demonstrated that learners followed the PA's prompts and feedback to help them set more appropriate subgoals for their learning session the majority of the time.
2	Descriptive statistics revealed that when subgoals were set collaboratively between learners and the PA, they generally lead to higher proportional learning gains when compared to less collaboratively set goals.
2	Taken together, the results provide preliminary evidence that learners are both willing to engage in and benefit from collaborative interactions with PAs when immediate, directional feedback and the opportunity to try again are provided.
2	Implications and future directions for extending co-and socially-shared regulated learning theories to include learner-PA interactions are proposed.

#### A Digital Coach That Provides Affective and Social Learning Support to Low-Literate Learners


1	In this study, we investigate if a digital coach for low-literate learners that provides cognitive learning support based on scaffolding can be improved by adding affective learning support based on motivational interviewing, and social learning support based on small talk.
1	Several knowledge gaps are identified: motivational interviewing and small talk must be translated to control rules for this coach, a formal model of participant emotional states is needed to allow the coach to parse the learner's emotional state, and various sensors must be used to let the coach detect and act on this state.
1	We use the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) method to update an existing foundation of knowledge with emotional models, motivational interviewing, and small talk theory, technology, and a new exercise in the volunteer work domain.
1	We use this foundation to create a design specification for an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) coach that provides cognitive, affective, and social learning support for this exercise.
1	A prototype is created, and compared to a prototype that only provides cognitive support in a within- and between-subjects experiment.
2	Results show that both prototypes work as expected: learners interact with the coach and complete all exercises.
2	Almost no significant differences are found between the two prototypes, indicating that the affective and social support were not effective as designed.
2	Potential improvements are provided for future work.
2	Results also show significant differences between two subgroups of low-literate participants, and between men and women, reinforcing the importance of using individualized support measures with this demographic.

0	We propose a novel concept, Be the Data, to explore the possibilities of using human's embodied resources to learn from high-dimensional data.
1	In our implemented system, each student embodies a data point, and the position of students in a physical space represents a 2D projection of the high-dimensional data.
1	Students physically move within the room with respect to each other to collaboratively construct alternative projections and receive visual feedback about relevant data dimensions.
1	In this way, students can pose hypotheses about the data to discover the statistical support as well as learn about complex concepts such as high-dimensional distance.

1	A first prototype of LANGA was tested in a small-scale, proof-of-concept study.
2	Changes in proficiency from preto post-training were measured using recall and recognition tests, while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to assess changes in brain activity related to lexical access over the course of learning.

1	In particular, we developed two different types of simulations for ARfract, namely a game-based simulation and a non-game simulation to explore how the order of different AR simulations influences the perceived usability, user behaviors, learning experiences, and learning outcomes.
1	For the experiment, 10 dyads were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: 1) the game-to-non-game condition and 2) the non-game-to-game condition.
1	The results indicate that the learners who experienced the game-based simulation before the non-game simulation performed better than did the other group with the reversed experience order.
1	This paper also reports the usability, user behaviors, and learning experience issues regarding the affordances of hybrid AR technologies.
2	The major contribution of this proof-of-concept research is that it articulates our understanding of how particular configurations (i.e., order) of the emerging technologies (i.e., hybrid Augmented Reality systems) and its use can lead to different learning outcomes.

1	Sentence-level lecture highlighting basically uses acoustic features from the audio and the output is implemented in subtitle files of corresponding MOOC videos.
2	In comparison with ground truth created by experts, the precision is over 60 percent, which is better than baseline works and also welcomed by user feedbacks.
2	On the other hand, segment-level lecture highlighting works with statistical analysis, mainly by exploring the speech transcripts, the lecture slides and their connections.
2	With the ground truth created by massive users, an evaluation process shows that general accuracy can reach 70 percent, which is fairly promising.
2	Finally, we also attempt to find potential correlation between these two types of lecture highlights.

#### Student Emotions in Conversation-Based Assessments


0	Students can experience a variety of emotions while completing assessments.
0	Some emotions can get in the way of students performing their best (e.g., anxiety, frustration), whereas other emotions can facilitate student performance (e.g., engagement).
0	Many new, non-traditional assessments, such as automated conversation-based assessments (CBA), are designed with the intention to create a test-taking experience that maximizes beneficial emotions for students and minimizes detrimental emotions.
0	However, there is a paucity of research on students' actual emotional experiences during these non-traditional assessments.
1	Across two studies, we investigated students' moment-to-moment emotions during two CBAs that differed on construct (science inquiry, mathematical reasoning) and environment (virtual world, chat box).
1	We found a similar set of emotions to frequently occur across the two studies and came to the preliminary conclusion that students have a generally positive experience with CBAs and that boredom, confusion, curiosity, delight, engagement/flow, frustration, happiness/enjoyment, hope, and pride are the prevalent emotions in CBAs.
1	The temporal dynamics of emotions as well as the emotion-performance relationship were also investigated across the two studies.
2	Lastly, we discuss how these findings can inform the development of emotion-sensitive CBAs that can facilitate students being able to perform to the best of their ability.

#### Let's Set Up Some Subgoals: Understanding Human-Pedagogical Agent Collaborations and Their Implications for Learning and Prompt and Feedback Compliance


0	Research on collaborative learning between humans and virtual pedagogical agents represents a necessary extension to recent research on the conceptual, theoretical, methodological, analytical, and educational issues behind co-and socially-shared regulated learning between humans.
1	This study presents a novel coding framework that was developed and used to describe collaborations between learners and a pedagogical agent (PA) during a subgoal setting activity with MetaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system.
1	Learner-PA interactions were examined across two scaffolding conditions: prompt and feedback (PF), and control.
1	Learners' compliance to follow the PA's prompts and feedback in the PF condition were also examined.
2	Results demonstrated that learners followed the PA's prompts and feedback to help them set more appropriate subgoals for their learning session the majority of the time.
2	Descriptive statistics revealed that when subgoals were set collaboratively between learners and the PA, they generally lead to higher proportional learning gains when compared to less collaboratively set goals.
2	Taken together, the results provide preliminary evidence that learners are both willing to engage in and benefit from collaborative interactions with PAs when immediate, directional feedback and the opportunity to try again are provided.
2	Implications and future directions for extending co-and socially-shared regulated learning theories to include learner-PA interactions are proposed.

#### A Digital Coach That Provides Affective and Social Learning Support to Low-Literate Learners


0	In this study, we investigate if a digital coach for low-literate learners that provides cognitive learning support based on scaffolding can be improved by adding affective learning support based on motivational interviewing, and social learning support based on small talk.
0	Several knowledge gaps are identified: motivational interviewing and small talk must be translated to control rules for this coach, a formal model of participant emotional states is needed to allow the coach to parse the learner's emotional state, and various sensors must be used to let the coach detect and act on this state.
0	We use the situated Cognitive Engineering (sCE) method to update an existing foundation of knowledge with emotional models, motivational interviewing, and small talk theory, technology, and a new exercise in the volunteer work domain.
1	We use this foundation to create a design specification for an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) coach that provides cognitive, affective, and social learning support for this exercise.
1	A prototype is created, and compared to a prototype that only provides cognitive support in a within- and between-subjects experiment.
2	Results show that both prototypes work as expected: learners interact with the coach and complete all exercises.
2	Almost no significant differences are found between the two prototypes, indicating that the affective and social support were not effective as designed.
2	Potential improvements are provided for future work.
2	Results also show significant differences between two subgroups of low-literate participants, and between men and women, reinforcing the importance of using individualized support measures with this demographic.

#### Be the Data: Embodied Visual Analytics


0	With the rise of big data, it is becoming increasingly important to educate groups of students at many educational levels about data analytics.
0	In particular, students without a strong mathematical background may have an unenthusiastic attitude towards high-dimensional data and find it challenging to understand relevant complex analytical methods, such as dimension reduction.
1	In this paper, we present an embodied approach for visual analytics designed to teach students about exploring alternative 2D projections of high-dimensional data points using weighted multidimensional scaling.
1	We propose a novel concept, Be the Data, to explore the possibilities of using human's embodied resources to learn from high-dimensional data.
1	In our implemented system, each student embodies a data point, and the position of students in a physical space represents a 2D projection of the high-dimensional data.
1	Students physically move within the room with respect to each other to collaboratively construct alternative projections and receive visual feedback about relevant data dimensions.
1	In this way, students can pose hypotheses about the data to discover the statistical support as well as learn about complex concepts such as high-dimensional distance.
1	We conducted educational workshops with students in various age groups inexperienced in complex data analytical methods.
2	Our findings indicate that Be the Data provided the necessary engagement to enable students to quickly learn about high-dimensional data and analysis processes despite their minimal prior knowledge.

#### Active Learning Environments with Robotic Tangibles: Children's Physical and Virtual Spatial Programming Experiences


0	As computational thinking becomes increasingly important for children to learn, we must develop interfaces that leverage the ways that young children learn to provide opportunities for them to develop these skills.
0	Active Learning Environments with Robotic Tangibles (ALERT) and Robopad, an analogous on-screen virtual spatial programming environment for educational Human Robot Interaction (HRI), have been developed.
1	Evaluations of these in the context of free play and open-ended learning activities show that both systems afford opportunities for young children to engage in spatial programming, creating improvisational and sequential programs that mediate interactions between the environment, robots, and humans in responsive and creative ways.
2	These systems demonstrate innovative opportunities for advancing mixed reality spatial programming activities as a form of HRI that fosters engaging seamless cyberlearning experiences, across formal and informal environments.

#### an Online Game-Based Platform for Second Language Learning


0	Computer and smartphone-based applications for second language (L2) learning have become popular tools, being integrated in many classroom-based courses and adopted by the public at large.
0	Yet, despite a significant body of research that suggests that individuals differ in their ability to learn L2, it is still unclear what factors predict successful L2 acquisition and how L2 teaching software can be designed to adapt to individuals' strengths and weaknesses.
1	Here, we describe the architecture of LANGA, an online game-based platform under development for L2 teaching and research, and present a demonstrative proof-of-concept study using the platform.
1	LANGA is designed to be both an effective and engaging product from the consumer perspective, and a tool that can be used by researchers to easily implement, deploy and test different training modalities for L2 teaching.
1	Furthermore, key features of LANGA include easy configuration of training via modular design; emphasis on gamified teaching methods; and the use of automated speech recognition to provide learners feedback on verbal production.
1	A first prototype of LANGA was tested in a small-scale, proof-of-concept study.
2	Changes in proficiency from preto post-training were measured using recall and recognition tests, while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were used to assess changes in brain activity related to lexical access over the course of learning.
2	The results provided initial validation of the platform: participants were able to learn a large proportion of the words taught, and retained the novel words in a two/weeks follow-up.
2	Future directions on the development of the platform are discussed.

#### Hybrid Augmented Reality for Participatory Learning: The Hidden Efficacy of Multi-User Game-Based Simulation


0	The goal of this research is to articulate and test a new hybrid Augmented Reality (AR) environment for conceptual understanding.
0	From the theoretical lens of embodied interaction, we have designed a multi-user participatory simulation called ARfract where visitors in a science museum can learn about complex scientific concepts on the refraction of light through full-body immersion using optical see-through AR glasses, projection-based AR, and gesture technology.
0	In particular, we developed two different types of simulations for ARfract, namely a game-based simulation and a non-game simulation to explore how the order of different AR simulations influences the perceived usability, user behaviors, learning experiences, and learning outcomes.
0	For the experiment, 10 dyads were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: 1) the game-to-non-game condition and 2) the non-game-to-game condition.
2	The results indicate that the learners who experienced the game-based simulation before the non-game simulation performed better than did the other group with the reversed experience order.
2	This paper also reports the usability, user behaviors, and learning experience issues regarding the affordances of hybrid AR technologies.
2	The major contribution of this proof-of-concept research is that it articulates our understanding of how particular configurations (i.e., order) of the emerging technologies (i.e., hybrid Augmented Reality systems) and its use can lead to different learning outcomes.

#### Approximately Optimal Teaching of Approximately Optimal Learners


1	We propose a method of generating teaching policies for use in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) for concept learning tasks [1] , e.g., teaching students the meanings of words by showing images that exemplify their meanings à la Rosetta Stone [2] and Duo Lingo [3] .
1	The approach is grounded in control theory and capitalizes on recent work by [4] , [5] that frames the “teaching” problem as that of finding approximately optimal teaching policies for approximately optimal learners (AOTAOL).
1	Our work expands on [4] , [5] in several ways: (1) We develop a novel student model in which the teacher's actions can partially eliminate hypotheses about the curriculum.
2	(2) With our student model, inference can be conducted analytically rather than numerically, thus allowing computationally efficient planning to optimize learning.
1	(3) We develop a reinforcement learning-based hierarchical control technique that allows the teaching policy to search through deeper learning trajectories.
2	We demonstrate our approach in a novel ITS for foreign language learning similar to Rosetta Stone and show that the automatically generated AOTAOL teaching policy performs favorably compared to two hand-crafted teaching policies.

#### Automatic Summarization of Lecture Slides for Enhanced Student PreviewTechnical Report and User Study


1	This paper is an extension of research originally reported in [1] .
1	Here, we propose a novel method for summarizing lecture slides to enhance students' preview efficiency and understanding of the content.
0	Students are often asked to prepare for a class by reading lecture materials.
0	However, because the attention span of students is limited, this is not always beneficial.
1	We surveyed 326 students regarding the preview of lecture materials, revealing a preference for summarized materials to preview.
1	Therefore, we developed an automatic summarization method for condensing original lecture materials into a summarized set.
1	Our proposed approach utilizes image and text processing to extract important pages from lecture materials, optimizing selection of pages in accordance with a specified preview time.
1	We applied the proposed summarization method to a set of lecture slides.
2	In an experiment with 372 students, we compared the effectiveness of the summarized slides and the original materials in terms of quiz scores, preview achievement ratio, and time spent previewing.
2	We found that students who previewed the summarized slides achieved better scores on pre-lecture quizzes, even though they spent less time previewing the material.

#### A Tool for Introducing Computer Science with Automatic Formative Assessment


1	In this paper we present a software platform called Chatbot designed to introduce high school students to Computer Science (CS) concepts in an innovative way: by programming chatbots.
1	A chatbot is a bot that can be programmed to have a conversation with a human or robotic partner in some natural language such as English or Spanish.
1	While programming their chatbots, students use fundamental CS constructs such as variables, conditionals, and finite state automata, among others.
1	Chatbot uses pattern matching, state of the art lemmatization techniques, and finite state automata in order to provide automatic formative assessment to the students.
1	When an error is found, the formative feedback generated is immediate and task-level.
1	We evaluated Chatbot in two observational studies.
1	An online nation-wide competition where more than 10,000 students participated.
1	And, a mandatory in-class 15-lesson pilot course in three high schools.
2	We measured indicators of student engagement (task completion, participation, self reported interest, etc.) and found that girls' engagement with Chatbot was higher than boys' for most indicators.
2	Also, in the online competition, the task completion rate for the students that decided to use Chatbot was five times higher than for the students that chose to use the renowned animation and game programming tool Alice.
2	Our results suggest that the availability of automatic formative assessment may have an impact on task completion and other engagement indicators among high school students.

#### Automatic Chinese Multiple Choice Question Generation Using Mixed Similarity Strategy


0	Automatic question generation can help teachers to save the time necessary for constructing examination papers.
0	Several approaches were proposed to automatically generate multiple-choice questions for vocalbuary assessment or grammar exercises.
0	However, most of these studies focused on generating questions in English with a certain similarity strategy.
1	This paper presents a mixed similarity strategy which generates Chinese multiple choice distractors with a statistical regression model including orthographic, phonological and semantic features, i.e., features that were shown in previous psycholinguistics studies to contribute to character recognition.
1	In a first experiment, we evaluated the predictive power of the proposed features in measuring Chinese character similarity.
2	One of the significant experimental results showed that the combination of the four proposed categories of features (structure, semantic radical, stroke and meaning) accounts for 62.5 percent of the variance in the human judgments of character similarity.
1	In the second experiment, a user study was conducted to evaluate the quality of system-generated questions using a test item analysis method.
1	Two hundred ninety-six Chinese primary school students (10-11-year-old) participated in this study.
1	We have compared the mixed strategy with another three common distractor generation strategies, orthographic strategy, semantic strategy, and phonological strategy.
2	One of important findings suggested that the mixed strategy significantly outperformed other three strategies in terms of the distractor usefulness and has a highest discrimination power among four strategies.

#### Learning Buckets: Helping Teachers Introduce Flexibility in the Management of Learning Artifacts Across Spaces


0	Technology offers rich opportunities for learning across different physical and virtual spaces.
0	However, most of current across-spaces proposals are either highly teacher-centered, inflexible in the students' self-management of learning artifacts during the enactment, or allow the teacher little/no control of such students' management of artifacts.
0	Moreover, these proposals tend to be disconnected from the practices and tools that are usual in the classroom.
0	How can we achieve a middle ground between keeping the teacher in control of across-spaces situations and, at the same time, providing students with a degree of flexibility to manage learning artifacts?
1	Aiming to address such a challenge we propose the notion of learning bucket, and the Bucket-Server, a system implementing such a notion.
1	A learning bucket is a container of learning artifacts which are generated and/or accessed across-spaces by the students during the enactment, according to constraints configured by teachers at design time.
1	The responsive evaluation conducted, based on a feature analysis and a pilot study with experts, suggests that learning buckets can help evolve from teacher- to student-centered approaches, while maintaining the teacher in control of students' actions.
2	The evaluation also indicates that the Bucket-Server surpasses the support provided by alternative proposals to across-spaces learning.

0	Orchestration load is the effort a teacher spends in coordinating multiple activities and learning processes.
0	It has been proposed as a construct to evaluate the usability of learning technologies at the classroom level, in the same way that cognitive load is used as a measure of usability at the individual level.
0	However, so far this notion has remained abstract.
1	In order to ground orchestration load in empirical evidence and study it in a more systematic and detailed manner, we propose a method to quantify it, based on physiological data (concretely, mobile eye-tracking measures), along with human-coded behavioral data.
1	This paper presents the results of applying this method to four exploratory case studies, where four teachers orchestrated technology-enhanced face-to-face lessons with primary, secondary school, and university students.
2	The data from these studies provide a first validation of this method in different conditions, and illustrate how it can be used to understand the effect of different classroom factors on orchestration load.

0	Effective collaboration between student peers is not spontaneous.
0	A system that can measure collaboration in real-time may be useful, as it could alert an instructor to pairs that need help in collaborating effectively.
0	We tested whether superficial measures of speech and user interface actions would suffice for measuring collaboration.
1	Pairs of students solved complex math problems while data were collected in the form of verbal interaction and user action logs from the students' tablets.
1	We distinguished four classifications of interactivity: collaboration, cooperation, high asymmetric contribution and low asymmetric contribution.
1	Human coders used richer data (several video streams) to choose one of these codes for each episode.
1	Thousands of features were extracted computationally from the log and audio data.
1	Machine learning was used to induce a detector that also assigned a code to each episode as a function of these features.
1	Detectors for combinations of codes were induced as well.
2	The best detector's overall accuracy was 96 percent (kappa = 0.92) compared to human coding.
2	This high level of agreement suggests that superficial features of speech and log data do suffice for measuring collaboration.
2	However, these results should be viewed as preliminary because the particular task may have made it relatively easy to distinguish collaboration from cooperation.

0	In order to process the large-scale unstructured text data, it is necessary to integrate the inductive content analysis method and educational data mining techniques.
1	An inductive content analysis on samples taken from 17,624 posts was implemented and the categories of teachers' reflective thinking were obtained.
1	Based on the results of inductive content analysis, we implemented a single-label text classification algorithm to classify the sample data.
1	Then, we applied the trained classification model on a large-scale and unexplored online discussion text data set and two types of visualizations of the results were provided.
1	By using the categories gained from inductive content analysis to create a radar map, teachers' reflection level was represented.
1	In addition, a cumulative adjacency matrix was created to characterize the evolution of teachers' reflective thinking.

0	This paper aims to explore if a game-based math test can provide added value to math education with respect to cognitive and affective outcomes.
1	We used in-game measures, embedded in the game called Semideus Exam, focusing on conceptual fraction knowledge.
1	In order to validate the game-based assessment approach, we compared the cognitive outcomes of 51 Finnish sixth graders, who completed both paper-based and game-based math tests in a randomized order.
1	In addition, the students' test anxiety and flow experience were measured to evaluate the affective outcomes.
2	The results indicate that the game-based test scores correlated significantly with the paper-based test scores suggesting that the game-based assessment was successfully implemented and the game provided comparable data with the paper-based test approach.
2	More importantly, the results revealed that game-based assessment lowered test anxiety and increased engagement which is likely to decrease assessment bias caused by test anxiety.
2	In addition, the results show that earlier playing experience and gender did not influence the game-based test score suggesting fairness of the game-based assessment approach.
2	Although we identified several benefits of the game-based assessment approach, more evidence is needed on the usefulness and fairness of game-based assessments.

#### From Learners to Earners: Enabling MOOC Learners to Apply Their Skills and Earn Money in an Online Market Place


0	Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) aim to educate the world.
0	More often than not, however, MOOCs fall short of this goal-a majority of learners are already highly educated (with a Bachelor's degree or more) and come from specific parts of the (developed) world.
0	Learners from developing countries without a higher degree are underrepresented, though desired, in MOOCs.
0	One reason for those learners to drop out of a course can be found in their financial realities and the subsequent limited amount of time they can dedicate to a course besides earning a living.
0	If we could pay learners to take a MOOC, this hurdle would largely disappear.

#### A Multimodal Assessment Framework for Integrating Student Writing and Drawing in Elementary Science Learning


0	Science learning is inherently multimodal, with students utilizing both drawings and writings to explain observations of physical phenomena.
0	As such assessments in science should accommodate the many ways students express their understanding, especially given evidence that understanding is distributed across both drawing and writing.
0	In recent years advanced automated assessment techniques that evaluate expressive student artifacts have emerged.

1	We propose a framework for the multimodal automated assessment of students' writing and drawing to leverage the synergies inherent across modalities and create a more complete and accurate picture of a student's knowledge.
1	We introduce a multimodal assessment framework as well as two computational techniques for automatically analyzing student writings and drawings: a convolutional neural network-based model for assessing student writing, and a topology-based model for assessing student drawing.
2	Evaluations with elementary students' writings and drawings collected with a tablet-based digital science notebook demonstrate that 1) each of the framework's two modalities provide an independent and complementary measure of student science learning, and 2) the computational methods are capable of accurately assessing student work from both modalities and offer the potential for integration in technology-rich learning environments for real-time formative assessment.

0	In this paper, we propose a process for adapting gaming features based on a player model.
1	This model is inspired from existing player typologies and types of gamification elements.
1	Our approach is implemented in a learning environment with five different gaming features, and evaluated with 266 participants.
2	The main results of this study show that, amongst the most engaged learners (i.e., learners who use the environment the longest), those with adapted gaming features spend significantly more time in the learning environment.
2	Furthermore, learners with features that are not adapted have a higher level of amotivation.

1	We study learning outcome prediction for online courses.
0	Whereas prior work has focused on semester-long courses with frequent student assessments, we focus on short-courses that have single outcomes assigned by instructors at the end.
0	The lack of performance data and generally small enrollments makes the behavior of learners, captured as they interact with course content and with one another in Social Learning Networks (SLN), essential for prediction.
1	Our method defines several (machine) learning features based on the processing of behaviors collected on the modes of (human) learning in a course, and uses them in appropriate classifiers.
1	Through evaluation on data captured from three two-week courses hosted through our delivery platforms, we make three key observations: (i) behavioral data contains signals predictive of learning outcomes in short-courses (with classifiers achieving AUCs ≥ 0.8 after the two weeks), (ii) early detection is possible within the first week (AUCs ≥ 0.7 with the first week of data), and (iii) the content features have an “earliest” detection capability (with higher AUC in the first few days), while the SLN features become the more predictive set over time as the network matures.
2	We also discuss how our method can generate behavioral analytics for instructors.

#### From Study Tactics to Learning Strategies: An Analytical Method for Extracting Interpretable Representations


0	Research into self-regulated learning has traditionally relied upon self-reported data.
0	While there is a rich body of literature that has extracted invaluable information from such sources, it suffers from a number of shortcomings.
0	For instance, it has been shown that surveys often provide insight into students' perceptions about learning rather than how students actually employ study tactics and learning strategies.
0	Accordingly, recent research has sought to assess students' learning strategies and, by extension, their self-regulated learning via trace data collected from digital learning environments.
0	A number of studies have amply demonstrated the ability of educational data mining and learning analytics methods to identify patterns indicative of learning strategies within trace log data.
0	However, many of these methods are limited in their ability to describe and interpret differences between extracted latent representations at varying levels of granularity (for instance, in terms of the underlying data of student actions and behavior).
0	To address this limitation, the present study proposes a new methodology whereby interpretable representations of student's self-regulating behavior are derived at two theoretically inspired levels: that of learning strategies, and the study tactics that compose them.

1	The system was implemented in a face-to-face heterogeneous classroom with 119 students from different departments who were not familiar with each other.
1	Students learned Geographic Information System (GIS) in a computer classroom in two groups: students, who learned without our on-call-tutor system, were in a control group whereas those, who learned with our on-call-tutor system, were in an experimental group.
1	When students had any difficulties during the learning process (e.g., to use GIS), they could request help face-to-face (the control group) or through the system (the experimental group).
1	When students requested help via the system, it selected one student from a pool of those who perceived himself/herself to have excellent learning progress and then assigned him/her as a tutor to a student in need (tutee).
1	We carried out this study to explore whether our on-call-tutor system is useful to facilitate peer-help activities and to enhance student learning performance.
1	To this end, based on the theoretical framework of this study, we designed an experiment in which learning performance and behavior of students in the two groups were explored and compared.
1	We also analyzed student social network and investigated whether it can be extended with the support of the on-call-tutor system.
1	Finally, factors that influence making a friend with an unfamiliar classmate and relationship among these factors were explored.
1	For the data analysis, we gathered student logs to send messages, to help peers, and their practice time.
1	We also collected students' responses to a questionnaire survey about their attitudes towards using our on-call-tutor system.
1	In addition, student learning performance was measured and interviews with students were carried out.
2	Our results showed that, compared to students in the control group, those in the experimental group had more peer-help activities and better learning performance.
2	Results also showed that students built their social network in which they interacted with each other and obtained/provided social support and useful knowledge for learning purpose.
2	In addition, we found that usefulness of our system for learning was the main factor that influenced students' willingness to build friendship in the social network with familiar/unfamiliar classmates and then communicate with them.
2	Based on our results, we suggest employing the on-call-tutor system in a heterogeneously grouped classroom in order to facilitate peer-help activities, especially when students learn difficult subjects like computer software and are not acquainted with one another.
2	Our system is useful for students in requesting help and finding a tutor in case when they need assistance or some further learning information.
2	With the assistance of our system, students can build the social network among classmates and communicate with each other in order to find/provide learning assistance and social support.
2	As a result, student peer-help activities can be facilitated and learning performance enhanced.

#### Personalized Affective Feedback to Address Students’ Frustration in ITS


0	The importance of affective states in learning has led many Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) to include students' affective states in their learner models.
0	The adaptation and hence the benefits of an ITS can be improved by detecting and responding to students' affective states.
0	In prior work, we have created and validated a theory-driven model for detecting students' frustration, as well as identifying its causes as students interact with the ITS.
1	In this paper, we present a strategy to respond to students' frustration by offering motivational messages that address different causes of frustration.
1	Based on attribution theory, these messages are created to praise the student's effort, attribute the results to the identified cause, show sympathy for failure or obtain feedback from the students.
1	We implemented our approach in three schools where students interacted with the ITS.
1	Data from 188 students from the three schools collected across two weeks was used for our analysis.
2	The results suggest that the frustration instances reduced significantly statistically (p <; 0:05), due to the motivational messages.
2	This study suggests that motivational messages that use attribution theory and address the reason for frustration reduce the number of frustration instances per session.

#### SciChallenge: A Social Media Aware Platform for Contest-Based STEM Education and Motivation of Young Students


0	Scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy.
0	Still, enrolment rates in STEM degrees are low in many European countries and consequently there is a lack of adequately educated workforce in industries.
0	We believe that this can be mainly attributed to pedagogical issues, such as the lack of engaging hands-on activities utilized for science and math education in middle and high schools.
1	In this paper, we report our work in the SciChallenge European project, which aims at increasing the interest of preuniversity students in STEM disciplines, through its distinguishing feature, the systematic use of social media for providing and evaluation of the student-generated content.
2	A social media-aware contest and platform were thus developed and tested in a panEuropean contest that attracted >700 participants.
2	The statistical analysis and results revealed that the platform and contest positively influenced participants STEM learning and motivation, while only the gender factor for the younger study group appeared to affect the outcomes (confidence level - p<;.05).

#### Using Machine Learning to Detect ‘Multiple-Account’ Cheating and Analyze the Influence of Student and Problem Features


0	One of the reported methods of cheating in online environments in the literature is CAMEO (Copying Answers using Multiple Existences Online), where harvesting accounts are used to obtain correct answers that are later submitted in the master account which gives the student credit to obtain a certificate.
0	In previous research, we developed an algorithm to identify and label submissions that were cheated using the CAMEO method; this algorithm relied on the IP of the submissions.
1	In this study, we use this tagged sample of submissions to i) compare the influence of student and problems characteristics on CAMEO and ii) build a random forest classifier that detects submissions as CAMEO without relying on IP, achieving sensitivity and specificity levels of 0.966 and 0.996, respectively.
2	Finally, we analyze the importance of the different features of the model finding that student features are the most important variables towards the correct classification of CAMEO submissions, concluding also that student features have more influence on CAMEO than problem features.

#### MOOCs as a Remedial Complement: Students’ Adoption and Learning Outcomes


0	The effectiveness of remedial mathematics courses in post-secondary education has been a controversial topic for years.
0	Higher Education institutions need their students to have basic understandings of the subjects to be imparted in the first semesters, but since they come with different backgrounds and prior knowledge, this is not always possible and many students struggle in their first courses.
1	This paper presents the results of students' adoption and learning outcomes of using four MOOCs as a complementary study resource for an on-campus calculus diagnostic exam.
1	Over 700 newly admitted university students had to take a mandatory diagnostic exam on four calculus topics before classes started.
1	MOOCs were proposed as a voluntary support for studying these subjects.
1	Following a mixed method analysis, we studied why and when the students used the online courses and we also measured the effects of its use in terms of the students' diagnostic exam grades and learning outcomes.
1	The results show that students mostly used the MOOCs to study the subjects that were not covered in their secondary studies.
2	Students who were active in these course topics obtained better scores, having more chances of passing the diagnostic exam than students who did not study with the MOOCs.
2	Furthermore, students not only used the MOOCs for studying for the exam, but also for refreshing concepts for future courses.

#### Improving Predictive Modeling for At-Risk Student Identification: A Multistage Approach


0	Performance prediction is a leading topic in learning analytics research due to its potential to impact all tiers of education.
1	This study proposes a novel predictive modeling method to address the research gaps in existing performance prediction research.
1	The gaps addressed include: the lack of existing research focus on performance prediction rather than identifying key performance factors; the lack of common predictors identified for both K-12 and higher education environments; and the misplaced focus on absolute engagement levels rather than relative engagement levels.
1	Two datasets, one from higher education and the other from a K-12 online school with 13 368 students in more than 300 courses, were applied using the predictive modeling technique.
2	The results showed the newly suggested approach had higher overall accuracy and sensitivity rates than the traditional approach.
2	In addition, two generalizable predictors were identified from instruction-intensive and discussion-intensive courses.

#### Developing Early Detectors of Student Attrition and Wheel Spinning Using Deep Learning


0	The increased usage of computer-based learning platforms and online tools in classrooms presents new opportunities to not only study the underlying constructs involved in the learning process, but also use this information to identify and aid struggling students.
0	Many learning platforms, particularly those driving or supplementing instruction, are only able to provide aid to students who interact with the system.
0	With this in mind, student persistence emerges as a prominent learning construct contributing to students success when learning new material.
0	Conversely, high persistence is not always productive for students, where additional practice does not help the student move toward a state of mastery of the material.
1	In this paper, we apply a transfer learning methodology using deep learning and traditional modeling techniques to study high and low representations of unproductive persistence.
1	We focus on two prominent problems in the fields of educational data mining and learner analytics representing low persistence, characterized as student “stopout,” and unproductive high persistence, operationalized through student “wheel spinning,” in an effort to better understand the relationship between these measures of unproductive persistence (i.e., stopout and wheel spinning) and develop early detectors of these behaviors.
2	We find that models developed to detect each within and across-assignment stopout and wheel spinning are able to learn sets of features that generalize to predict the other.
2	We further observe how these models perform at each learning opportunity within student assignments to identify when interventions may be deployed to best aid students who are likely to exhibit unproductive persistence.

#### A Quest for a One-Size-Fits-All Neural Network: Early Prediction of Students at Risk in Online Courses


0	A significant amount of research effort has been put into finding variables that can identify students at risk based on activity records available in learning management systems (LMS).
0	These variables often depend on the context, for example, the course structure, how the activities are assessed or whether the course is entirely online or a blended course.
0	To the best of our knowledge, a predictive model that can generalize well to many different types of courses using data available in the LMS does not currently exist in the learning analytics literature.
1	In this study, early prediction of students at risk is tackled by training a number of neural networks to predict which students would likely submit their assignments on time based on their activity up to two days before assignments' due dates.
1	Five different datasets that cover a total of 78 722 student enrolments in 5487 courses have been used in this study.
1	In order to improve how well the neural networks generalize, our networks can perform different forms of feature engineering using course peers data.
1	The different architectures of these networks have been compared to find the one with more predictive power.
1	To validate the models trained from the networks, both new datasets and unseen examples extracted from the same datasets have been used for training.
2	Our research show that adding contextual information results in better prediction accuracies and F1 scores.
2	Our networks are able to give predictions with accuracies in the 67.46-81.63% range and F1 scores in the 71.30-83.09% range.

#### How Widely Can Prediction Models Be Generalized? Performance Prediction in Blended Courses


0	Blended courses that mix in-person instruction with online platforms are increasingly common in secondary education.
0	These platforms record a rich amount of data on students' study habits and social interactions.
0	Prior research has shown that these metrics are correlated with students performance in face-to-face classes.
0	However, predictive models for blended courses are still limited and have not yet succeeded at early prediction or cross-class predictions, even for repeated offerings of the same course.
1	In this paper, we use data from two offerings of two different undergraduate courses to train and evaluate predictive models of student performance based on persistent student characteristics including study habits and social interactions.
1	We analyze the performance of these models on the same offering, on different offerings of the same course, and across courses to see how well they generalize.
1	We also evaluate the models on different segments of the courses to determine how early reliable predictions can be made.
2	This paper tells us in part how much data is required to make robust predictions and how cross-class data may be used, or not, to boost model performance.
2	The results of this study will help us better understand how similar the study habits, social activities, and the teamwork styles are across semesters for students in each performance category.
2	These trained models also provide an avenue to improve our existing support platforms to better support struggling students early in the semester with the goal of providing timely intervention.

#### Interpretable Multiview Early Warning System Adapted to Underrepresented Student Populations


0	Early warning systems have been progressively implemented in higher education institutions to predict student performance.
0	However, they usually fail at effectively integrating the many information sources available at universities to make more accurate and timely predictions, they often lack decision-making reasoning to motivate the reasons behind the predictions, and they are generally biased toward the general student body, ignoring the idiosyncrasies of underrepresented student populations (determined by socio-demographic factors such as race, gender, residency, or status as a freshmen, transfer, adult, or first-generation students) that traditionally have greater difficulties and performance gaps.
1	This paper presents a multiview early warning system built with comprehensible Genetic Programming classification rules adapted to specifically target underrepresented and underperforming student populations.
1	The system integrates many student information repositories using multiview learning to improve the accuracy and timing of the predictions.
1	Three interfaces have been developed to provide personalized and aggregated comprehensible feedback to students, instructors, and staff to facilitate early intervention and student support.
2	Experimental results, validated with statistical analysis, indicate that this multiview learning approach outperforms traditional classifiers.
2	Learning outcomes will help instructors and policy-makers to deploy strategies to increase retention and improve academics.

#### Multiview Learning for Early Prognosis of Academic Performance: A Case Study


0	Educational data mining has gained a lot of attention among scientists in recent years and constitutes an efficient tool for unraveling the concealed knowledge in educational data.
0	Recently, semisupervised learning methods have been gradually implemented in the educational process demonstrating their usability and effectiveness.
0	Cotraining is a representative semisupervised method aiming to exploit both labeled and unlabeled examples, provided that each example is described by two features views.
0	Nevertheless, it is yet to be used in various scientific fields, among which the educational field as well, since the assumption about the existence of two feature views cannot be easily put into practice.
1	Within this context, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a proposed cotraining method for early prognosis of undergraduate students' performance in the final examinations of a distance course based on a plethora of attributes which are naturally divided into two distinct views, since they are originated from different sources.
1	More specifically, the first view consists of attributes regarding students' characteristics and academic achievements which are manually filled out by their tutors, whereas the second one consists of attributes tracking students' online activity in the course learning management system and which are automatically recorded by the system.
2	The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed cotraining method as opposed to state-of-the-art semisupervised and supervised methods.

#### Predicting the Risk of Academic Dropout With Temporal Multi-Objective Optimization


0	In the European academic systems, the public funding to single universities depends on many factors, which are periodically evaluated.
0	One of such factors is the rate of success, that is, the rate of students that do complete their course of study.
0	At many levels, therefore, there is an increasing interest in being able to predict the risk that a student will abandon the studies, so that (specific, personal) corrective actions may be designed.
0	In this paper, we propose an innovative temporal optimization model that is able to identify the earliest moment in a student's career in which a reliable prediction can be made concerning his/her risk of dropping out from the course of studies.
2	Unlike most available models, our solution can be based on the academic behavior alone, and our evidence suggests that by ignoring classically used attributes such as the gender or the results of pre-academic studies one obtains more accurate, and less biased, models.
1	We tested our system on real data from the three-year degree in computer science offered by the University of Ferrara (Italy).

0	Developing tools to support students and learning in a traditional or online setting is a significant task in today's educational environment.
0	The initial steps toward enabling such technologies using machine learning techniques focused on predicting the student's performance in terms of the achieved grades.
0	However, these approaches do not perform as well in predicting poor-performing students.
0	The objective of our work is twofold.
1	First, in order to overcome this limitation, we explore if poorly performing students can be more accurately predicted by formulating the problem as binary classification, based on data provided before the start of the semester.
1	Second, in order to gain insights as to which are the factors that can lead to poor performance, we engineered a number of human-interpretable features that quantify these factors.
1	These features were derived from the students' grades from the University of Minnesota, an undergraduate public institution.
1	Based on these features, we perform a study to identify different student groups of interest, while at the same time, identify their importance.
2	As the resulting models provide us with different subsets of correct predictions, their combination can boost the overall performance.

#### An Early Feedback Prediction System for Learners At-Risk Within a First-Year Higher Education Course


0	Identifying at-risk students as soon as possible is a challenge in educational institutions.
0	Decreasing the time lag between identification and real at-risk state may significantly reduce the risk of failure or disengage.
0	In small courses, their identification is relatively easy, but it is impractical on larger ones.
0	Current Learning Management Systems store a large amount of data that could help to generate predictive models to early identification of students in online and blended learning.
1	The contribution of this paper is twofold: First, a new adaptive predictive model is presented based only on students' grades specifically trained for each course.
1	A deep analysis is performed in the whole institution to evaluate its performance accuracy.
1	Second, an early warning system is developed, focusing on dashboards visualization for stakeholders (i.e., students and teachers) and an early feedback prediction system to intervene in the case of at-risk identification.
1	The early warning system has been evaluated in a case study on a first-year undergraduate course in computer science.

#### From Lab to Production: Lessons Learnt and Real-Life Challenges of an Early Student-Dropout Prevention System


0	This paper presents the work done to support student dropout risk prevention in a real online e-learning environment: A Spanish distance university with thousands of undergraduate students.
0	The main goal is to prevent students from abandoning the university by means of retention actions focused on the most at-risk students, trying to maximize the effectiveness of institutional efforts in this direction.
1	With this purpose, we generated predictive models based on the C5.0 algorithm using data from more than 11,000 students collected along five years.
1	Then, we developed SPA (Sistema de Predicciæn de Abandono, dropout prediction system in Spanish), an early warning system that uses these models to generate static early dropout-risk predictions and dynamic periodically updated ones.
1	It also supports the recording of the resulting retention-oriented interventions for further analysis.
1	SPA is in production since 2017 and is currently in its fourth semester of continuous use.
1	It has calculated more than 117,000 risk scores to predict the dropout risk of more than 5700 students.
1	About 13,000 retention actions have been recorded.
2	The white-box predictive models used in production provided reasonably good results, very close to those obtained in the laboratory.
2	On the way from research to production, we faced several challenges that needed to be effectively addressed in order to be successful.
2	In this paper, we share the challenges faced and the lessons learnt during this process.
2	We hope this helps those who wish to cross the road from predictive modeling with potential value to the exploitation of complete dropout prevention systems that provide sustained value in real production scenarios.

1	Then, we proposed a TrAdaBoost-based transfer learning model, which was pretrained using the data of the former course iteration and applied to the current course iteration.
1	Our results showed that the generalization ability of the prediction model across the teaching iterations is high, and the model can achieve relatively high precision even when the new data are not sufficient to train a model alone.
2	This work helped in timely intervention toward the at-risk students.
1	In addition, two intervention experiments with split-test were conducted separately in Fall 2017 and Summer 2018.

0	Therefore, contact-free, sensor-based experiments can be linked with relating, near-eye presented multiple representations.
0	We will present a first approach on how Smart Glasses can be used as an experimental tool for head-centered, context-aware, wearable-technology-enhanced, and inquiry-based learning in physics education.
0	Therefore, we developed an app that is based on the Google Glass platform and designed to perform educational physical experiments on the topic of acoustics.
1	Its initial application is intended for high-school students whose task is to study the relationship between the frequency of the sound generated by hitting a glass of water and the amount of water in the glass.
1	The core idea is to have Google Glass automatically measure both the water fill level with the camera and the sound frequency with the microphone, and incrementally generate a fill level/frequency graph in the HMD.
1	We designed an educational setting and studied its effect on cognitive and affective variables with an intervention-control-group design.
1	While the intervention group analyzed the fill level/frequency relationship with the Google Glass platform, control group 1 worked on the phenomenon using the same platform implemented on a tablet PC.
1	Control group 2 analyzed the phenomenon using a tablet PC with a typical mobile-based education platform.
1	We used a two-way ANCOVA to study learning outcome, wondering, curiosity, cognitive load, and experimentation time as dependent variables of 46 high-school eighth-graders together with group membership and gender influence as independent variables.
2	While the positive effects of using Google Glass as a mobile lab on wondering and curiosity as well as a positive trend for experimentation time were detected, no differences were analyzed for learning achievement.
2	Although students have a higher cognitive load when working with Google Glass compared to other devices, the cognitive load level is very low in general.

0	Exergames that combine exercise with gaming have been recognized as a possible method for motivating children to become physically active and to make PE more fun.
0	Furthermore, exergames that utilize wearable sensors devices allow players' movements to be tracked for estimating the efficiency of exercise.
1	In this study, we developed the Running Othello 2 (RO2) exergame, where players wear a smartphone and a smart wrist band to compete in a board game enhanced with physical and pedagogical missions.
1	In physical missions, the game uses inertial sensors and a heart rate meter to detect the physical activities of players.
1	The pedagogical part of the game is based on the South Korean PE curriculum.
1	We evaluated RO2 with 61 South Korean third grade elementary school students, 32 of whom learned curriculum topics by playing the game.
1	The other 29 students comprised a control group who studied the pedagogical content using handouts.
2	The results indicated that learning with RO2 was more efficient, the players were engaged, and their heart rates increased.

1	In particular, we highlight the ways youth sometimes privileged their embodied recollections over the device's seemingly accurate data.
1	The article also provides a case of a day during implementation when youth converged on a single form of resistance, game conversion, and examines their reasoning and alternate forms of data validation that we saw in-action on that day.
2	Finally, we discuss benefits to learning and critical engagement that result from users' disputes and conclude by positing the promise in designing physical activity monitors for engagement, instead of exclusively persuasion or reward.

#### Introducing IoT and Wearable Technologies into Task-Based Language Learning for Young Children


0	In the last few years, in an attempt to further motivate students to learn a foreign language, there has been an increasing interest in task-based teaching techniques, which emphasize communication and the practical use of language, thus moving away from the repetitive grammar-translation methods.
0	Within this approach, the significance of situating foreign language learners in scenarios where they can meaningfully learn has become a major priority for many educators.
0	This approach is particularly relevant in the context of teaching foreign languages to young children, who need to be introduced to a new language by means of very concrete vocabulary, which is facilitated by the use of objects that they can handle and see.
1	In this study, we investigate the benefits of using wearable and Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies in streamlining the creation of such realistic task-based language learning scenarios.
2	We show that the use of these technologies will prove beneficial by freeing the instructors of having to keep records of the tasks performed by each student during the class session.
2	Instead, instructors can focus their efforts on creating a friendly environment and encouraging students to participate.
2	Our study sets up a basis for showing the great benefits of using wearable and IoT technologies in streamlining 1) the creation of realistic scenarios in which young foreign language learners can feel comfortable engaging in chat and becoming better prepared for social interaction in a foreign language, and 2) the acquisition and processing of performance metrics.

0	The use of IoT as a technology enhanced learning (TEL) tool created the learning conditions to be studied: (a) collaborative: no one person had the knowledge to complete the project alone, (b) problem-based: no off the shelf solution was used, and (c) multidisciplinary: the learning context pushed the boundaries across the subjects.
0	The study investigated the learning conditions and indicators of collaboration and production taking place when learning about STEM.
1	The results were used to inform the design of effective data analytics and visualization tools for the PELARS project to advance practice-based learning activities in STEM teaching.
1	However, more specifically, the findings provide insight into the knowledge construction process when learning through making in complex environments.
2	These insights illustrate the combined pedagogical value of collaboration and production supporting the multidisciplinary learning opportunities.
2	The importance of community knowledge construction and its relationship to the pedagogical approach is examined.
2	The significance of these findings in the context of IoT TEL tools in education is explored.

#### A Methodology to Obtain Learning Effective Laboratories with Learning Management System Integration


0	Online laboratories are useful and valuable resources in high education, especially in engineering studies.
1	This work presents a methodology to create effective laboratories for learning that interact with a Learning Management System (LMS) to achieve advanced integration.
1	It is based on pedagogical aspects and considers not only the laboratory application itself but also related resources that complement it.
1	The methodology is flexible, covers all possible cases, and it is structured in stages that can be used with any system architecture, standards, or type of online laboratory (virtual, remote, or hybrid) because it abstracts technical aspects at a high level.
1	This methodology facilitates the creation of new online labs so that any teacher, even those without specialized knowledge, can clarify many of the questions that may arise and gain understanding of how to implement an effective online laboratory with LMS integration to assist learning.
2	As an example and validation of the methodology, this work describes a laboratory developed as a Shared Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) package which is hosted in the institutional LMS at the University of Jaen.
2	The laboratory was presented to 338 students taking an Industrial Automation class, and student evaluations were quite positive.

#### A Debate and Decision-Making Tool for Enhanced Learning


0	Debates have been used to develop critical thinking within teaching environments.
0	Many learning activities are configured as working groups, which use debates to make decisions.
0	Nevertheless, in a classroom debate, only a few students can participate; large work groups are similarly limited.
0	Whilst the use of web tools would appear to offer a convenient solution, none of those currently available provides an automated system for organizing contributions into a logical structure, or for making decisions.
1	To address this problem, this paper describes a new tool for managing and structuring debates over the Internet, and presents the results of a series of trials in an educational context.
1	The tool enables users to post opinions and proposals, and to make multiple group decisions.
1	The main advantages are that it does not require a moderator, and all contributions are automatically arranged into an intuitive structure.
2	Thus, it enabled large groups to carry out bigger projects.
2	Empirical results showed that it also encouraged the involvement of all the students in debates and allowed the participation of each student to be evaluated.
2	The tool demonstrated its advantages over traditional oral debates and, as far as we are aware, it incorporates features not found in any other comparable web tool.

#### Agent Supported Serious Game Environment


0	This study proposes and applies a novel concept for an AI enhanced serious game collaborative environment as a supplementary learning tool in tertiary education.
0	It is based on previous research that investigated pedagogical agents for a serious game in the OpenSim environment.
1	The proposed AI features to support the serious game are the following: a) a pedagogical game agent, b) non-playing characters, c) chat bots, and d) a game interface called “Progress Map”.
0	This study aims to explore whether the utilization of AI features in game based collaborative learning in a tertiary education course can positively affect students' attitudes towards the course and educational games, students' game performance, as well as the students' perception of their learning environment.
2	Summarizing, even though the intelligent game environment does not affect students' attitudes, neither towards the course nor towards the educational games, it has a positive impact on the performance of the teams and so it can be considered useful in collaborative game based learning.
2	Moreover, the intelligent game environment improves the cohesiveness in the classroom after the completion of the game activity in terms of helping, supporting, and becoming connected to each-other.

#### Analyzing the Impact of Using Optional Activities in Self-Regulated Learning


0	Self-regulated learning (SRL) environments provide students with activities to improve their learning (e.g., by solving exercises), but they might also provide optional activities (e.g., changing an avatar image or setting goals) where students can decide whether they would like to use or do them and how.
0	Few works have dealt with the use of optional activities in SRL environments.
1	This paper thus analyzes the use of optional activities in two case studies with a SRL approach.
2	We found that the level of use of optional activites was low with only 23.1 percent of students making use of some functionality, while the level of use of learning activities was higher.
2	Optional activities which are not related to learning are used more.
2	We also explored the behavior of students using some of the optional activities in the courses such as setting goals and voting comments, finding that students finished the goals they set in more than 50 percent of the time and that they voted their peers' comments in a positive way.
2	We also found that gender and the type of course can influence which optional activities are used.
2	Moreover, the relations of the use of optional activities with proficient exercises and learning gains is low when taking out third variables, but we believe that optional activities might motivate students and produce better learning in an indirect way.

#### BH-ShaDe: A Software Tool that Assists Architecture Students in the Ill-Structured Task of Housing Design


1	In this paper, we present BH-ShaDe, a new software tool to assist architecture students learning the ill-structured domain/task of housing design.
0	The software tool provides students with automatic or interactively generated floor plan schemas for basic houses.
0	The students can then use the generated schemas as initial seeds to develop complete residential projects.
0	The main goal of our research was to obtain evidence about whether or not such schemas can be useful to architecture students.
1	A first prototype of the tool was evaluated with 78 students, with positive results.
2	However, the students seemed to demand increased user participation, so they could contribute to generating better quality starting points.
2	A second prototype was therefore implemented, allowing a higher degree of interactivity.
2	The second prototype was evaluated with a new group of 50 students.
2	From the two evaluations performed, it can be concluded that both versions of the tool were able to generate useful starting points (either automatically or interactively) that expedited the design process.
2	Additionally, in the second experiment, we found that neither the nature (automatic or interactive) nor the quality of the starting point seems to have any effect on the perceived quality of the final projects.

#### Designing a Secure Exam Management System (SEMS) for M-Learning Environments


0	M-learning has enhanced the e-learning by making the learning process learner-centered.
0	However, enforcing exam security in open environments where each student has his/her own mobile/tablet device connected to a Wi-Fi network through which it is further connected to the Internet can be one of the most challenging tasks.
0	In such environments, students can easily exchange information over the network during exam time.
1	This paper aims to identify various vulnerabilities that may violate exam security in m-learning environments and to design the appropriate security services and countermeasures that can be put in place to ensure exam security.
1	It also aims to integrate the resulting secure exam system with an existing, open-source, and widely accepted Learning Management System (LMS) and its service extension to the m-learning environment, namely “the Moodbile Project”.

#### Early Prediction of Student Profiles Based on Performance and Gaming Preferences


0	State of the art research shows that gamified learning can be used to engage students and help them perform better.
0	However, most studies use a one-size-fits-all approach to gamification, where individual differences and needs are ignored.
0	In a previous study, we identified four types of students attending a gamified college course, characterized by different levels of performance, engagement and behavior.
1	In this paper, we present a new experiment where we study what data best characterizes each of our student types and explore if this data can be used to predict a student's type early in the course.
1	To this end, we used machine-learning algorithms to classify student data from one term and predict the students' type on another term.
1	We identified two sets of relevant features that best describe our types, one containing only performance measurements and another also containing data regarding the students' gaming preferences.
1	Results show that performance alone can be used to predict student type with 79 percent accuracy by midterm.
2	However, its accuracy improves when paired with gaming data at earlier stages of the course.
2	In this paper, we clearly describe our findings and discuss the lessons learned from this experiment.

#### Supporting Semantic Annotation of Educational Content by Automatic Extraction of Hierarchical Domain Relationships


0	The domain model is an essential part of an adaptive learning system.
0	For each educational course, it involves educational content and semantics, which is also viewed as a form of conceptual metadata about educational content.
0	Due to the size of a domain model, manual domain model creation is a challenging and demanding task for teachers or content (and metadata) authors.
0	We propose a method for the automated acquisition of hierarchical relationships between relevant domain terms from educational content, which constitutes a fundamental step in the semantic composition of an educational course.
1	The method is based on existing text mining methods and applied to educational content.
1	We evaluate our approach by performing several experiments.
2	The evaluation shows that the method's performance is very promising.
2	A study in a real-user scenario reveals that despite the fact that utilization of our method does not necessarily improve the speed of the domain model creation nor does it reduce the overall difficulty of the task, a significant improvement in the quality of resulting domain models has been observed.
2	Our work is a promising contribution to the growing field of automated domain model acquisition.

#### Novel Approach to Facilitating Tradeoff Multi-Objective Grouping Optimization


0	The grouping problem is critical in collaborative learning (CL) because of the complexity and difficulty in adequate grouping, based on various grouping criteria and numerous learners.
0	Previous studies have paid attention to certain research questions, and the consideration for a number of learner characteristics has arisen.
0	Such a multi-objective grouping problem is with conflicting grouping objectives, involving the benefit objective (e.g. learning achievement) and cost objective (e.g. class rank) which are conflicting in different directions.
0	This study first proposed a novel approach based on the enhancement of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) with the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) for facilitating the tradeoff multi-objective grouping optimization, and based on the proposed approach further developed a web-based group support system to help educators for adequate grouping of homogeneous inter-group and heterogeneous intra-group.
1	In addition, the distribution of learners in the class was considered for group formation.
1	Two types of experiments were conducted; one involved a performance analysis against a GA and the Random approach, and the other entailed a study on CL with 90 participants.
1	The experimental results showed the following: 1) The proposed approach is not only more effective than a GA and the Random approach but also more efficient than a GA. 2) As a grouping strategy, the proposed approach can facilitate improved learning performance with statistical significance; in other words, the developed system is able to adequately allocate learners to teams for facilitating CL.

#### Don't Be a Stranger-Designing a Digital Intercultural Sensitivity Training Tool that is Culture General


0	Digital intercultural training tools play an important role in helping people to mediate cultural misunderstandings.
0	In recent years, these tools were made to teach about specific cultures, but there has been little attention for the design of a tool to teach about differences across a wide range of cultures.
0	In this work, we take the first steps to create a digital self-contained culture-general training tool.
0	In the first part of the article, we focus on different aspects and methods of intercultural training.
1	This information is then used in the second part to evaluate the effect of these different methods on the perception of behaviour in misunderstandings.
2	We found that experiential and story-based approaches may lead to different perceptions of participants.
1	In the third part, we expanded on these critical incidents, and incorporated virtual characters, to evaluate if experiential incidents in an embedded story can lead to an attribution of perceived differences in behaviour to specific differences in culture and to users becoming less judgemental of inappropriate behaviours by people from different cultures.
2	The results suggest that the tool had some effect, but that a debriefing relating the general differences to specific instances would be beneficial.

#### VirTUal remoTe labORatories Management System (TUTORES): Using Cloud Computing to Acquire University Practical Skills


0	The use of practical laboratories is a key in engineering education in order to provide our students with the resources needed to acquire practical skills.
0	This is specially true in the case of distance education, where no physical interactions between lecturers and students take place, so virtual or remote laboratories must be used.
1	UNED has developed a system to create and manage virtual remote laboratories, aimed at improving the way how practical exercises are conducted.
1	This system is based on cloud computing and virtualization concepts.
1	These Virtual Remote Laboratories (VRLabs) combine features of traditional virtual and remote laboratories but with clear differences over them, among others, VRLabs do not necessarily access real physical devices but are not based on simulations either.
1	Each student is provided with a virtual remote laboratory based on virtualization that he/she will access through the Internet and will use to implement his/her practical assignments.
1	We present details on how these laboratories are implemented for a subject in a post-degree program in our University.
2	Furthermore, we also present an evaluation of the system used on such subject aiming at assessing the quality of the system regarding three different concepts, namely perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived interaction.
2	This evaluation is twofold, first, we have conducted a survey over the students of the subject, and second, we have performed another survey over the teaching team of the subject, both have been performed for the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 academic years.

#### An Investigation of a Two-Tier Test Strategy in a University Calculus Course: Causes versus Consequences


0	Online tests have been identified as a core learning activity in higher education.
0	Unlike conventional online tests, which cannot completely reflect students' learning status, two-tier tests not only consider students' answers, but also take into account reasons for their answers.
0	Due to such significance, research into the two-tier tests had mushroomed but few studies examined why the two-tier test approach was effective.
0	To this end, we conducted an empirical study, where a lag sequential analysis was used to analyze behavior patterns while qualitative data from the questionnaire were applied to explain why these behavior patterns were happened.
2	The results indicated students with a two-tier test tended to realize the rationale of a concept, instead of relying on their memories.
2	In other words, the two-tier test can facilitate students to develop deep thinking skills.
2	This may be because they considered the two-tier test as a learning tool, instead of an assessment tool only.

#### Item Response Theory for Peer Assessment


0	As an assessment method based on a constructivist approach, peer assessment has become popular in recent years.
0	However, in peer assessment, a problem remains that reliability depends on the rater characteristics.
0	For this reason, some item response models that incorporate rater parameters have been proposed.
0	Those models are expected to improve the reliability if the model parameters can be estimated accurately.
0	However, when applying them to actual peer assessment, the parameter estimation accuracy would be reduced for the following reasons.
0	1) The number of rater parameters increases with two or more times the number of raters because the models include higher-dimensional rater parameters.
0	2) The accuracy of parameter estimation from sparse peer assessment data depends strongly on hand-tuning parameters, called hyperparameters.
0	To solve these problems, this article presents a proposal of a new item response model for peer assessment that incorporates rater parameters to maintain as few rater parameters as possible.
0	Furthermore, this article presents a proposal of a parameter estimation method using a hierarchical Bayes model for the proposed model that can learn the hyperparameters from data.
2	Finally, this article describes the effectiveness of the proposed method using results obtained from a simulation and actual data experiments.

#### Creating Engaging Online Learning Material with the JSAV JavaScript Algorithm Visualization Library


0	Data Structures and Algorithms are a central part of Computer Science.
0	Due to their abstract and dynamic nature, they are a difficult topic to learn for many students.
0	To alleviate these learning difficulties, instructors have turned to algorithm visualizations (AV) and AV systems.
0	Research has shown that especially engaging AVs can have an impact on student learning of DSA topics.
0	Until recently, most AV systems were Java-based systems.
0	But, the popularity of Java has declined and is being supplanted by HTML5 and JavaScript content online.
0	In this paper, we present JSAV: the JavaScript AV development library.
1	JSAV goes beyond traditional AV library support for displaying standard data structures components, to provide functionality to simplify creation of AVs on many engagement levels including interactive exercises.
2	We describe the growing body of content created with JSAV and summarize our three years of experience and research results from using JSAV to build content that supports CS education.

#### ToothPIC: An Interactive Application for Teaching Oral Anatomy


0	This paper describes the development and evaluation of an interactive educational program, ToothPlacement and Identification Coach (ToothPIC).
0	The program uses a game-based learning paradigm and 3D visualization techniques to allow first year dentistry and hygiene students to get familiar with dental anatomy.
2	It provides an interactive and stimulating learning tool for acquiring basic dental skills outside of the classroom.
2	Specifically, it uses interactive 3D graphics to teach students to identify, name, number, align, and orient teeth into their proper location in the dental arch.
1	ToothPIC incorporates elements of a game to make learning attractive for the student.
1	In the process, the student learns not only about the 3D features of each tooth but also about the proper placement of the tooth relative to the gingiva and other teeth.
1	ToothPIC has two modules: Module 1 includes 32 permanent upper and lower teeth that are to be identified and placed into the surrounding gingiva.
1	Module 2 only shows the individual teeth, one at a time, to be identified (similar to a “flash-card”).
1	The evaluation results of ToothPIC indicate that students strongly agree that program meets its goals of self-training and self-evaluation, actively involves the students in learning and is a useful supplement to laboratory practices and lectures.

#### An Approach Based on Social Network Analysis Applied to a Collaborative Learning Experience


0	The Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques allow modelling and analysing the interaction among individuals based on their attributes and relationships.
0	This approach has been used by several researchers in order to measure the social processes in collaborative learning experiences.
0	But oftentimes such measures were calculated at the final state of experiences, what may be hardly representative of students' behaviours during the learning processes.
0	Therefore, a temporal dimension in SNA metrics may extend and improve the understanding about students' interactions in a collaborative scenario.
1	In this respect, this paper presents a systematic review about SNA metrics used for analysing CSCL scenarios and proposes to trace the behaviour of such metrics during experiences through the inclusion of a temporal dimension.
1	In order to expose this approach, a real collaborative learning experience, supported by a platform called SMLearning System, was analysed.
2	We found that social relationships among students tend to be symmetric, i.e., there was a proportional distribution of efforts and contributions of students, which is an expected condition in a collaborative scenario.
2	Such observations are based on the temporal behaviour of the reciprocity metric and the correlation between in- and out- degree centrality metrics measured in time.

#### Flipping the Flipped Classroom: A Study of the Effectiveness of Video Lectures Versus Constructivist Exploration Using Tangible User Interfaces


0	In this study, we show results that suggest tangible user interfaces (TUIs) may be used to prepare students for future learning.
0	In a previous study, we found that students who used interactive tabletops before studying a text significantly outperformed participants who read a text first and used tabletops subsequently.
0	These findings demonstrate that discovery-learning approaches are better suited to TUIs than traditional “tell-and-practice” approaches.
0	In our current effort, we generalize our findings to a different population, a different learning material, and a different topic.
1	In this study, we employ the tangible interface, Combinatorix (Fig.1), which enables small groups of students to work collaboratively and discover concepts in probability.
1	Our system supports students' explorations of principles in combinatorics (i.e., permutations and combinations) that serve as foundations for learning about probability.
1	We describe the design of Combinatorix, as well as an experiment that examined the interaction between focused lectures and free exploration.
2	We found that students who first explored the topic on a tangible interface and then watched a video lecture significantly outperformed students who watched a lecture first and then completed a hands-on activity.
2	We discuss how the “functional fixedness” induced by the video lecture limited the students' learning of probability, and conclude with guidelines for implementing interactive tabletops in classrooms.

#### Development and Evaluation of an Active Learning Support System for Context-Aware Ubiquitous Learning


0	Situating students to learn from the real world has been recognized as an important and challenging issue.
0	However, in a real-world learning environment, there are usually many physical constraints that affect the learning performance of students, such as the total learning time, the limitation of the number of students who can visit a learning target, and the time needed for moving from one learning location to another.
0	It is essential to guide the students along an efficient learning path to maximize their learning performance according to the current situation.
1	In this paper, an active learning support system (ALESS) for context-aware ubiquitous learning environments is designed and developed.
2	ALESS can provide learning guidance when conducting ubiquitous learning activities.
1	A great deal of context information is used in ALESS, including the location, the current capacity of the learning object, the time available, etc.
2	ALESS is able to actively provide the required learning support to individual students when they approach the corresponding real-world learning targets.

0	The aim of this study was to investigate how supporting the learner focus on meaningful activities affects behavior and learning performance.
1	The sample was 82 students, who were randomly assigned to two groups.
1	The control group used AR-SaBEr with no support for recommending activities.
1	The experimental group had personalized extra support designed to help learners focus on the subject matters that they did not master.
2	The study found that learners from the experimental group showed better learning achievements than those who participated in the control group.
2	Furthermore, learners' behavioral patterns were dependent upon the support received.
2	Learners from the control group were more willing to browse information about activities than to read about the subject before experimenting.
2	Learners from the experimental group browsed information about prior to carrying them out and read about the subject matter prior to experimentation.
2	The observed behavioral patterns and learning achievements suggest that in augmented reality based simulation environments, it is worth providing mechanisms to focus the attention of students on the most relevant topics for them.

0	However, the effectiveness of in-video quizzes has not previously been assessed.
1	In this paper, we describe the construction and instrumentation of an Interactive Video Lecture Platform to measure student engagement with in-video quizzes.
1	We also investigate the use of in-video quizzes as an approach to mitigate the lack of feedback available to students and lecturers in videos and traditional lectures.
1	Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of augmenting video with the ability to answer and receive feedback to quiz questions embedded directly within the video.
2	We observed that student engagement with in-video questions was consistently high (71-86 percent) across two cohorts ($N_1$= 81,$N_2$= 84) with a rate of one question per 8.7 minutes of video.
2	We identified three broad levels of engagement with the quiz questions and four motivations, including challenge seeking and completionism, which explain some of the observed behaviour.
2	The results from this investigation demonstrate that in-video quizzes were successful in creating an engaging and interactive mode of content delivery.
2	We recommend that in-video quizzes be used to increase the interactivity of video content as well as supporting formative assessment within a flipped classroom environment.

0	To perform this task, user profiling mechanisms should be implemented to automatically construct and update meaningful user profiles.
0	These profiles can drive the RS in providing informed recommendations suited to the unique characteristics of each user.
0	In the context of technology enhanced learning (TeL) Recommender Systems, the majority of research focus directly on learners' profiling and ignore the potential benefits of profiling teachers' professional capacities too.

1	We focused on the case where students' errors were not due to a lack of knowledge but to a simple mistake.
1	Specifically, we consider the context of traditional assessment methods that feature do-it-again feedback that can focus on the simple mistake, as opposed to conceptual knowledge or logic.
1	The proposed scheme aims to identify and visualize measurable features of behavior that leads to mistakes among students engaged in problem-solving activities.
1	As a pilot study, we placed students in one of two groups: high-scoring and average-scoring students on a national standardized mathematics test in the Republic of Korea.
1	Then, using a tablet computer, we collected information on the handwriting and navigation behavior of students during problem solving with millisecond precision and determined its meaningful features.
1	During the experiments, 15 of the 45 participants were trained on certain features of problem-solving behavior, identified in the pilot study.
1	Three problem-solving assessments were performed, and two training sessions were provided.
2	The results showed that students who trained in problem-solving behaviors achieved an improvement of approximately 14 percent, without additional knowledge training.

#### Evaluating Recommender Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning: A Quantitative Survey


0	The increasing number of publications on recommender systems for Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) evidence a growing interest in their development and deployment.
0	In order to support learning, recommender systems for TEL need to consider specific requirements, which differ from the requirements for recommender systems in other domains like e-commerce.
0	Consequently, these particular requirements motivate the incorporation of specific goals and methods in the evaluation process for TEL recommender systems.
1	In this article, the diverse evaluation methods that have been applied to evaluate TEL recommender systems are investigated.
1	A total of 235 articles are selected from major conferences, workshops, journals, and books where relevant work have been published between 2000 and 2014.
1	These articles are quantitatively analysed and classified according to the following criteria: type of evaluation methodology, subject of evaluation, and effects measured by the evaluation.
2	Results from the survey suggest that there is a growing awareness in the research community of the necessity for more elaborate evaluations.
2	At the same time, there is still substantial potential for further improvements.
2	This survey highlights trends and discusses strengths and shortcomings of the evaluation of TEL recommender systems thus far, thereby aiming to stimulate researchers to contemplate novel evaluation approaches.

#### A Hybrid Trust-Based Recommender System for Online Communities of Practice


0	The needs for life-long learning and the rapid development of information technologies promote the development of various types of online Community of Practices (CoPs).
0	In online CoPs, bounded rationality and metacognition are two major issues, especially when learners face information overload and there is no knowledge authority within the learning environment.
1	This study proposes a hybrid, trust-based recommender system to mitigate above learning issues in online CoPs.
1	A case study was conducted using Stack Overflow data to test the recommender system.
2	Important findings include: (1) comparing with other social community platforms, learners in online CoPs have stronger social relations and tend to interact with a smaller group of people only; (2) the hybrid algorithm can provide more accurate recommendations than celebrity-based and content-based algorithm and; (3) the proposed recommender system can facilitate the formation of personalized learning communities.
