## TCP Reno over Adaptive CSMA

0 	An interesting distributed adaptive CSMA MAC protocol, called adaptive CSMA, was proposed recently to schedule any strictly feasible achievable rates inside the capacity region.
0 	Of particular interest is the fact that the adaptive CSMA can achieve a system utility arbitrarily close to that is achievable under a central scheduler.However, a specially designed transport-layer rate controller is needed for this result.
0 	An outstanding question is whether the widely-installed TCP Reno is compatible with adaptive CSMA and can achieve the same result.
0 	The answer to this question will determine how close to practical deployment adaptive CSMA is.	Our answer is yes and no.
1	First, we observe that running TCP Reno directly over adaptive CSMA results in severe starvation problems.
2 	Effectively, its performance is no better than that of TCP Reno over legacy CSMA (IEEE 802.11), and the potentials of adaptive CSMA cannot be realized.
2 	Fortunately, we find that multi-connection TCP Reno over adaptive CSMA with active queue management can materialize the advantages of adaptive CSMA.
2 	NS-2 simulations demonstrate that our solution can alleviate starvation and achieve fair and efficient rate allocation.
2 	Multi-connection TCP can be implemented at either application or transport layer.
2 	Application-layer implementation requires no kernel modification, making the solution readily deployable in networks running adaptive CSMA.

## Optimal Pricing Effect on Equilibrium Behaviors of Delay-Sensitive Users in Cognitive Radio Networks

0 	This paper studies price-based spectrum access control in cognitive radio networks, which characterizes network operators' service provisions to delay-sensitive secondary users (SUs) via pricing strategies.
0 	Based on the two paradigms of shared-use and exclusive-use dynamic spectrum access (DSA), we examine three network scenarios corresponding to three types of secondary markets.
0	In the first monopoly market with one operator using opportunistic shared-use DSA, we study the operator's pricing effect on the equilibrium behaviors of self-optimizing SUs in a queueing system. %
0 	This queue represents the congestion of the multiple SUs sharing the operator's single \ON-\OFF channel that models the primary users (PUs) traffic.
1 	We provide a queueing delay analysis with the general distributions of the SU service time and PU traffic using the renewal theory.
1 	In terms of SUs, we show that there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative game where SUs are players employing individual optimal strategies.
1 	We also provide a sufficient condition and iterative algorithms for equilibrium convergence.
1 	In terms of operators, two pricing mechanisms are proposed with different goals: revenue maximization and social welfare maximization.
1 	In the second monopoly market, an operator exploiting exclusive-use DSA has many channels that will be allocated separately to each entering SU.
2 	We also analyze the pricing effect on the equilibrium behaviors of the SUs and the revenue-optimal and socially-optimal pricing strategies of the operator in this market.
1 	In the third duopoly market, we study a price competition between two operators employing shared-use and exclusive-use DSA, respectively, as a two-stage Stackelberg game.
2 	Using a backward induction method, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium for this game and investigate the equilibrium convergence.

## Noisy Distance Measurements Using 3-D Localization with Rb-Rf Methods

0 	Long time monitoring applications are environment monitoring, security surveillance and habitat monitoring.
0 	Further, where it can be deployed in time critical situations when disaster happens.
0 	As we are dealing with the human lives here, we can not just rely on the localization schemes that depend upon the connectivity information Rf i.e. range-free algorithms only.
0 	Further, rescue operations are carried out in highly noisy environments, so distance based Rb(range-based) localization algorithms generate high error in distance measurements.
1 	An efficient algorithm is needed that can measure the location of the sensor nodes near to the living being or being attached to them in 3-D space with a high accuracy.
1 	To achieve such kind of accuracy a combination of both the strategies is required.
1 	The proposed method which incorporates both the Rb(range-based)&Rfrange-free strategies that successfully localizes nodes in a sensor network with noisy distance measurements.
1 	We also have depicted the effect of scalability on the performance of the algorithm.
2 	Results show that as the scalability of the network increases with the number of beacon nodes; the performance of the algorithm goes high above 90 percent .
1 	The granularity of the areas estimated may be easily adjusted by changing the system parameters which makes the proposed algorithm flexible.

## Nontransitive Ranking to Enhance Routing Decision in MANETS

0 	An ad hoc network is an infrastructureless network in which nodes perform terminal as well as routing functions.
0 	A routing protocol is the only substitute to complete the communications in the absence of an access point.
1 	In spite of that mobile nodes or so called routers uses some mechanism for calculating the best route when it has multiple routes for the same destination.
1 	On the basis of one or more metrics routes are ranked from best to worst.
1 	But, in an ad hoc network many factors can affect this decision, such as the delay, load, route lifetime etc.
1 	Thus measuring and finding routes on the basis of crisp mathematical model for all these attributes is complicated.
1 	That why, the fuzzy approach for best route determination is required for MANET because some of the metrics are fuzzy or vague and the classical ranking of routes and transitivity in the ranking does not hold.
1 	The proposed Nontransitive Route Ranking subjective comparison of one route with others and performs nontransitive ranking to rank routes from best to worst.
2 	The pairwise comparisons of each route with others give more accurate and fair comparison.
2 	The proposed ranking is easier than classical ranking in which metrics have assigned some value and these values are combined to obtain the ranking.
2 	Experimental result shows the efficiency of the proposed model.

## Bounded Mean-Delay Throughput and Non-Starvation Conditions in Aloha Network

0 	This paper considers the requirements to ensure bounded mean queuing delay and non-starvation in a slotted Aloha network operating the exponential backoff protocol.
0 	It is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted Aloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679.
0 	Indeed, a saturation throughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r = e/(e-1)=1.5820.
0 	The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority of prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the Ethernet and WiFi.
0 	For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r = 2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise objection to adopting r = 2 in the system.
0 	However, this paper shows that if mean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2 is only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e .
0  Fortunately, the optimal setting of r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve sustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to 1/e.
2 	A general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the queuing delay performance.
2 	Besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper also delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived of service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system.
1 	Specifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that the conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are one of the same, thus uniting these two notions.
2 	Finally, we show that when mean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained from simulation experiments may not converge.
2 	A quantitative discussion of this issue is provided in this paper.

## On the Packet Allocation of Multi-Band Aggregation Wireless Networks

0 	The use of heterogeneous networks with multiple radio access technologies (RATs) is a system concept that both academia and industry are studying.
0 	In such system, integrated use of available multiple RATs is essential to achieve beyond additive throughput and connectivity gains using multi-dimensional diversity.
0 	This paper considers an aggregation module called opportunistic multi-MAC aggregation (OMMA).
0 	It resides between the IP layer and the air interface protocol stacks, common to all RATs in the device.
1 	We present a theoretical framework for such system while considering a special case of multi-RAT systems, i.e., a multi-band wireless LAN (WLAN) system.
1 	An optimal packet distribution approach is derived which minimizes the average packet latency (the sum of queueing delay and serving delay) over multiple bands.
1 	It supports multiple user terminals with different QoS classes simultaneously.
1 	We further propose a packet scheduling algorithm, OMMA Leaky Bucket, which minimizes the packet end-to-end delay, i.e., the sum of average packet latency and average packet reordering delay.
1 	We also describe the system architecture of the proposed OMMA system, which is applicable for the general case of the multi- RAT devices.
1 	It includes functional description, discovery and association processes, and dynamic RAT update management.
2 	We finally present simulation results for a multi-band WLAN system.
2 	It shows the performance gains of the proposed OMMA Leaky Bucket scheme in comparison to other existing packet scheduling mechanisms.

## Suporte à Mobilidade em Redes Mesh Sem Fio: estratégias comuns versus SDN

0 	Wireless mesh networks have been presented as a robust, scalable and low cost solution to provide connectivity in long distance areas.
0 	However, given its nature, routing strategies must support seamless mobility of nodes while enabling operation with a good performance and fast self-recovery from links fault.
0 	The routing approaches that meet these requirements are based on protocols usually used in ad-hoc networks (e.g. OLSR and B.A.T.M.A.N.) and, more recently, in the SDN paradigm (e.g. OpenWiMesh), each one of them having its own pros and cons.
0 	Therefore, it is important to evaluate the benefits and impacts of each approach, taking into account models and metrics inherent to the mobility.
1 	In this paper, we propose a simplified implementation of mobility support in OpenWiMesh and evaluate its performance compared to other protocols, using differents mobility and data traffic models.
1 	The chosen metrics are based on packet loss, occupation of the links with control traffic and delay.
2 	Simulated results show that the SDN approach perform better than the classic protocols, beyond flexibility and programmability of SDN itself.

## Flexibility of Networks: a new measure for network design space analysis?

0 	Flexibility is often claimed as a competitive advantage when proposing new network designs.
0 	However, most proposals provide only qualitative arguments for their improved support of flexibility.
0 	Quantitative arguments vary a lot among different proposals.
0 	A general understanding for flexibility is not yet clearly defined, leaving it to the reader to draw the right conclusions based on background information.
0 	The term flexibility is commonly defined as the ability to adapt to changes.
0 	For networks, flexibility would refer to the ability to adapt the available network resources, such as flows or topology, to changes of design requirements, e.g., shorter latency budgets or different traffic distributions.
0 	Recent concepts such as Software Defined Networking, Network Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization have emerged claiming to provide more flexibility in networks.
0 	Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of what flexibility means and how it could be quantified to compare different network designs remains open.
0 	In this paper, we ask whether flexibility can be a new measure for network design space analysis.
1 	As it is quite challenging to formulate a flexibility measure that covers all network aspects, we propose an initial set of flexibility aspects to start grounding guidelines.
1 	Our initial selection is backed up by an analysis of Software Defined Networking, Network Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization for their support of the selected flexibility aspects.
1 	Our research methodology is based on a systematic approach that leads to network design guidelines with respect to flexibility.

## Dynamic Virtual Machine Management via Approximate Markov Decision Process

0 	Efficient virtual machine (VM) management can dramatically reduce energy consumption in data centers.
0 	Existing VM management algorithms fall into two categories based on whether the VMs' resource demands are assumed to be static or dynamic.
0 	The former category fails to maximize the resource utilization as they cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of VMs' resource demands.
0 	Most approaches in the latter category are heuristical and lack theoretical performance guarantees.
1 	In this work, we formulate dynamic VM management as a large-scale Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and derive an optimal solution.
1 	Our analysis of real-world data traces supports our choice of the modeling approach.
1 	However, solving the large-scale MDP problem suffers from the curse of dimensionality.
1 	Therefore, we further exploit the special structure of the problem and propose an approximate MDP-based dynamic VM management method, called MadVM.
1 	We prove the convergence of MadVM and analyze the bound of its approximation error.
1 	Moreover, MadVM can be implemented in a distributed system, which should suit the needs of real data centers.
1 	Extensive simulations based on two real-world workload traces show that MadVM achieves significant performance gains over two existing baseline approaches in power consumption, resource shortage and the number of VM migrations.
1 	Specifically, the more intensely the resource demands fluctuate, the more MadVM outperforms.

## DynaChanAl: Dynamic Channel Allocation with Minimal End-to-end Delay for Wireless Sensor Networks

0 	With recent advances in wireless communication, networking, and low power sensor technology, wireless sensor network (WSN) systems have begun to take significant roles in various applications ranging from environmental sensing to mobile healthcare sensing.
0 	While some WSN applications only require a lim- ited amount of bandwidth, new emerging applications operate with a notice- ably large amount of data transfers.
0 	One way to deal with such applications is to maximize the available capacity by utilizing the use of multiple wireless channels.
1 	This work proposes DynaChannAl, a distributed dynamic wireless channel algorithm with the goal of effectively distributing nodes on multiple wireless channels in WSN systems.
1 	Specifically, DynaChannAl targets applica- tions where mobile nodes connect to a pre-existing wireless backbone and takes the expected end-to-end queuing delay as its core metric.
1 	We use the link qual- ity indicator (LQI) values provided by IEEE 802.15.4 radios white-list potential links with good link quality and evaluate such links with the aggregated packet transmission latency at each hop.
1 	Our approach is useful for applications that require minimal end-to-end delay (i.e., healthcare applications).
1 	DynaChannAl is a light weight and highly adoptable scheme that can be easily incorporated with various pre-developed components and pre-deployed applications.
2 	We eval- uate DynaChannAl in on a 45 node WSN testbed.
2 	As the first study to consider end-to-end latency as the core metric for channel allocation in WSN systems, the experimental results indicate that DynaChannAl successfully distributes multi- ple (mobile) source nodes on different wireless channels and enables the nodes to select wireless channel and links that can minimize the end-to-end latency.

## Temporal Starvation in CSMA Wireless Networks

0 	It is well known that links in CSMA wireless networks are prone to starvation.
0 	Prior works focused almost exclusively on equilibrium starvation.
0 	In this paper, we show that links in CSMA wireless networks are also susceptible to temporal starvation.
0 	Specifically, although some links have good equilibrium throughputs and do not suffer from equilibrium starvation, they can still have no throughput for extended periods from time to time.
0 	Given its impact on quality of service, it is important to understand and characterize temporal starvation.
1 	To this end, we develop a "trap theory" to analyze temporal throughput fluctuation.
1 	The trap theory serves two functions.
1 	First, it allows us to derive new mathematical results that shed light on the transient behavior of CSMA networks.
1 	For example, we show that the duration of a trap, during which some links receive no throughput, is insensitive to the distributions of the backoff countdown and transmission time (packet duration) in the CSMA protocol.
1 	Second, we can develop analytical tools for computing the "degrees of starvation" for CSMA networks to aid network design.
1 	For example, given a CSMA network, we can determine whether it suffers from starvation, and if so, which links will starve.
1 	Furthermore, the likelihood and durations of temporal starvation can also be computed.
2 	We believe that the ability to identify and characterize temporal starvation as established in this paper will serve as an important first step toward the design of effective remedies for it.

## A Cluster Based Replication Architecture for Load Balancing in Peer-to-Peer Content Distribution

0 	In P2P systems, large volumes of data are declustered naturally across a large number of peers.
0 	But it is very difficult to control the initial data distribution because every user has the freedom to share any data with other users.
0 	The system scalability can be improved by distributing the load across multiple servers which is proposed by replication.
0 	The large scale content distribution systems were improved broadly using the replication techniques.
0 	The demanded contents can be brought closer to the clients by multiplying the source of information geographically, which in turn reduce both the access latency and the network traffic.
0 	In addition to this, due to the intrinsic dynamism of the P2P environment, static data distribution cannot be expected to guarantee good load balancing.
0 	If the hot peers become bottleneck, it leads to increased user response time and significant performance degradation of the system.
0 	Hence an effective load balancing mechanism is necessary in such cases and it can be attained efficiently by intelligent data replication.
1 	In this paper, we propose a cluster based replication architecture for load-balancing in peer-to-peer content distribution systems.
1 	In addition to an intelligent replica placement technique, it also consists of an effective load balancing technique.
1 	In the intelligent replica placement technique, peers are grouped into strong and weak clusters based on their weight vector which comprises available capacity, CPU speed, access latency and memory size.
1 	In order to achieve complete load balancing across the system, an intracluster and inter-cluster load balancing algorithms are proposed.
2 	We are able to show that our proposed architecture attains less latency and better throughput with reduced bandwidth usage, through the simulation results.

## Throughput Computation in CSMA Wireless Networks with Collision Effects

0 	It is known that link throughputs of CSMA wireless networks can be computed from a time-reversible Markov chain arising from an ideal CSMA network model (ICN).
0 	In particular, this model yields general closed-form equations of link throughputs.
0 	However, an idealized and important assumption made in ICN is that the backoff countdown process is in "contiuous-time" and carrier sensing is instantaneous.
0 	As a result, there is no collision in ICN.
0 	In practical CSMA protocols such as IEEE 802.11, the stations count down in "mini-timeslot" and the process is therefore a "discrete-time" process.
0 	In particular, two stations may end their backoff process in the same mini-timeslot and then transmit simultaneously, resulting in a packet collision.
0 	This paper is an attempt to study how to compute link throughputs after taking such backoff collision effects into account.
1 	We propose a generalized ideal CSMA network model (GICN) to characterize the collision states as well as the interactions and dependency among links in the network.
2 	We show that link throughputs and collision probability can be computed from GICN.
2 	Simulation results validate GICN's accuracy.
2 	Interestingly, we also find that the original ICN model yields fairly accurate results despite the fact that collisions are not modeled.

## Measuring Pulsed Interference in 802.11 Links

0 	Wireless 802.11 links operate in unlicensed spectrum and so must accommodate other unlicensed transmitters which generate pulsed interference.
1 	We propose a new approach for detecting the presence of pulsed interference affecting 802.11 links, and for estimating temporal statistics of this interference.
1 	This approach builds on recent work on distinguishing collision losses from noise losses in 802.11 links.
1 	When the intervals between interference pulses are i.i.d.,the approach is not confined to estimating the mean and variance of these intervals but can recover the complete probability distribution.
1 	The approach is a transmitter-side technique that provides per-link information and is compatible with standard hardware.
1 	We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using extensive experimental measurements.
1 	In addition to applications to monitoring, management and diagnostics, the fundamental information provided by our approach can potentially be used to adapt the frame durations used in a network so as to increase capacity in the presence of pulsed interference.

## Cognitive Radio Networks: Realistic or Not?

0 	A large volume of research has been conducted in the cognitive radio (CR) area the last decade.
0 	However, the deployment of a commercial CR network is yet to emerge.
0 	A large portion of the existing literature does not build on real world scenarios, hence, neglecting various important interactions of the research with commercial telecommunication networks.
0 	For instance, a lot of attention has been paid to spectrum sensing as the front line functionality that needs to be completed in an efficient and accurate manner to enable an opportunistic CR network architecture.
0 	This is necessary to detect the existence of spectrum holes without which no other procedure can be fulfilled.
0 	However, simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy received from a primary transmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access.
0 	For example, the low strength of a primary transmitter's signal does not assure that there will be no interference to a nearby primary receiver.
0 	In addition, the presence of a primary transmitter's signal does not mean that CR network users cannot access the spectrum since there might not be any primary receiver in the vicinity.
0 	Despite the existing elegant and clever solutions to the DSA problem no robust, implementable scheme has emerged.
1 	In this paper, we challenge the basic premises of the proposed schemes.
1 	We further argue that addressing the technical challenges we face in deploying robust CR networks can only be achieved if we radically change the way we design their basic functionalities.
1 	In support of our argument, we present a set of real-world scenarios, inspired by realistic settings in commercial telecommunications networks, focusing on spectrum sensing as a basic and critical functionality in the deployment of CRs.
1 	We use these scenarios to show why existing DSA paradigms are not amenable to realistic deployment in complex wireless environments.

## Multiple Target Tracking with RF Sensor Networks

0 	RF sensor networks are wireless networks that can localize and track people (or targets) without needing them to carry or wear any electronic device.
0 	They use the change in the received signal strength (RSS) of the links due to the movements of people to infer their locations.
1 	In this paper, we consider real-time multiple target tracking with RF sensor networks.
1 	We perform radio tomographic imaging (RTI), which generates images of the change in the propagation field, as if they were frames of a video.
1 	Our RTI method uses RSS measurements on multiple frequency channels on each link, combining them with a fade level-based weighted average.
1 	We describe methods to adapt machine vision methods to the peculiarities of RTI to enable real time multiple target tracking.
1 	Several tests are performed in an open environment, a one-bedroom apartment, and a cluttered office environment.
2 	The results demonstrate that the system is capable of accurately tracking in real-time up to 4 targets in cluttered indoor environments, even when their trajectories intersect multiple times, without mis-estimating the number of targets found in the monitored area.
2 	The highest average tracking error measured in the tests is 0.45 m with two targets, 0.46 m with three targets, and 0.55 m with four targets.

## Shortest Path versus Multi-Hub Routing in Networks with Uncertain Demand

0 	We study a class of robust network design problems motivated by the need to scale core networks to meet increasingly dynamic capacity demands.
0 	Past work has focused on designing the network to support all hose matrices (all matrices not exceeding marginal bounds at the nodes).
0 	This model may be too conservative if additional information on traffic patterns is available.
0 	Another extreme is the fixed demand model, where one designs the network to support peak point-to-point demands.
1 	We introduce a capped hose model to explore a broader range of traffic matrices which includes the above two as special cases.
1 	It is known that optimal designs for the hose model are always determined by single-hub routing, and for the fixed- demand model are based on shortest-path routing.
1 	We shed light on the wider space of capped hose matrices in order to see which traffic models are more shortest path-like as opposed to hub-like.
1 	To address the space in between, we use hierarchical multi-hub routing templates, a generalization of hub and tree routing.
1 	In particular, we show that by adding peak capacities into the hose model, the single-hub tree-routing template is no longer cost-effective.
1 	This initiates the study of a class of robust network design (RND) problems restricted to these templates.
1 	Our empirical analysis is based on a heuristic for this new hierarchical RND problem.
1 	We also propose that it is possible to define a routing indicator that accounts for the strengths of the marginals and peak demands and use this information to choose the appropriate routing template.
2 	We benchmark our approach against other well-known routing templates, using representative carrier networks and a variety of different capped hose traffic demands, parameterized by the relative importance of their marginals as opposed to their point-to-point peak demands.

## Homology-based Distributed Coverage Hole Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks

0 	Homology theory provides new and powerful solutions to address the coverage problems in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).
0 	They are based on algebraic objects, such as Cech complex and Rips complex.
0 	Cech complex gives accurate information about coverage quality but requires a precise knowledge of the relative locations of nodes.
0 	This assumption is rather strong and hard to implement in practical deployments.
0 	Rips complex provides an approximation of Cech complex.
0 	It is easier to build and does not require any knowledge of nodes location.
0 	This simplicity is at the expense of accuracy.
0 	Rips complex can not always detect all coverage holes.
0 	It is then necessary to evaluate its accuracy.
1 	This work proposes to use the proportion of the area of undiscovered coverage holes as performance criteria.
1 	Investigations show that it depends on the ratio between communication and sensing radii of a sensor.
1 	Closed-form expressions for lower and upper bounds of the accuracy are also derived.
1 	For those coverage holes which can be discovered by Rips complex, a homology-based distributed algorithm is proposed to detect them.
2 	Simulation results are consistent with the proposed analytical lower bound, with a maximum difference of 0.5%.Upper bound performance depends on the ratio of communication and sensing radii.
2 	Simulations also show that the algorithm can localize about 99% coverage holes in about 99% cases.

## Network Utility Aware Traffic Loading Balancing in Backhaul-constrained Cache-enabled Small Cell Networks with Hybrid Power Supplies

0 	Explosive data traffic growth leads to a continuous surge in capacity demands across mobile networks.
0 	In order to provision high network capacity, small cell base stations (SCBSs) are widely deployed.
0 	Owing to the close proximity to mobile users, SCBSs can effectively enhance the network capacity and offloading traffic load from macro BSs (MBSs).
0 	However, the cost-effective backhaul may not be readily available for SCBSs, thus leading to backhaul constraints in small cell networks (SCNs).
0 	Enabling cache in BSs may mitigate the backhaul constraints in SCNs.
0 	Moreover, the dense deployment of SCBSs may incur excessive energy consumption.
0 	To alleviate brown power consumption, renewable energy will be explored to power BSs.
0 	In such a network, it is challenging to dynamically balance traffic load among BSs to optimize the network utilities.
1 	In this paper, we investigate the traffic load balancing in backhaul-constrained cache-enabled small cell networks powered by hybrid energy sources.
1 	We have proposed a network utility aware (NUA) traffic load balancing scheme that optimizes user association to strike a tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic delivery latency.
1 	On balancing the traffic load, the proposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme considers the green power utilization, the traffic delivery latency in both BSs and their backhaul, and the cache hit ratio.
1 	The NUA traffic load balancing scheme allows dynamically adjusting the tradeoff between the green power utilization and the traffic delivery latency.
2 	We have proved the convergence and the optimality of the proposed NUA traffic load balancing scheme.
2 	Through extensive simulations, we have compared performance of the NUA traffic load balancing scheme with other schemes and showed its advantages in backhaul-constrained cache-enabled small cell networks with hybrid power supplies.

## Cross-Layer Extended Persistent Timeout Policy for SCTP and DSDV

0 	Cross layer techniques applied to various protocols stacks provide fair information sharing between OSI model layers.
0 	The performance gains have been demonstrated for many studied systems within protocols interactions.
0 	The example is illustrative of the reliable transport protocols that use retransmissions to achieve that reliability function.
0 	The performance gains of the persistent timeout policy for the management of the retransmission timeout have been produce in some recent works when applying that persistent timeout policy only to reliable transport protocol.
0 	The goal was to give an appropriate behavior in response to a bad state of the wireless channel that occurs and temporally blocks the transmission of data.The channel state is given by the 802.11 link layer through cross-layer mechanism.
1 	In this paper, the persistent policy is extended to the network layer and is applied to a stack that uses a reactive routing protocol, namely the Destination Sequenced Distance-Vector (DSDV) protocol that also generates additional periodic traffic regardless to the channel state.
1 	We are measuring the influence in terms of performance gains of the extended persistent policy because of the additional periodic signalization messages deriving from the used routing protocol.
1 	After the introduction in section I; Section II of this paper presents an overview of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP).
2 	Section III describes the behavior of the DSDV protocol.
2 	Section IV presents the extended persistent timeout policy principle and Section V presents the simulation results used to compare the using of the traditional and the extended persistent timeout policies applied to the same protocol stack using SCTP and DSDV.

## Cross layer Interaction Models for SCTP and OLSR

0 	The evolution from wired system to the wireless environment opens a set of challenge for the improvement of the wireless system performances because of many of their weakness compared to wired networks.
0 	To achieve this goal, cross layer techniques are used to facilitate the sharing of information between the layers of the OSI model.
0 	In some precedent works, the Reverse Cross Layer (RCL) method has been proposed to facilitate the design of cross layer conceptual models.
0 	The method has the advantage to highlight the impact of each cross layer interaction on each protocol in order to update its source code and to describe the intuitive gains that can be achieve.
0 	The method may be applied to a given protocol stack or to an existent cross layer model to integrate new interactions.
1 	In this paper, we are applying the RCL method on the stack that uses the Stream Control Transport Protocol (SCTP) at the transport layer and the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) at the network layer.
1 	Cross layer conceptual models are produced based on new cross layer interactions that are proposed to populate the environment subsystem built with the application of the RCL method.
1 	The improvement of the environment subsystem is specified through the performance gains provide by the new interactions.
1 	The implementation of the interactions that impact the SCTP protocol is described in the Interaction Description Array.
1 	After the introduction, Section II of this paper presents an overview of the SCTP protocol.
1 	Section III is related to the overview of the OLSR protocol.
1 	Section IV is used for the application of the RCL method and the different interaction arrays it generates.
2 	Section V presents the improvement of the environment subsystem and the definition of the performance gain of each Cross Layer Atomic Action (CLAA).

## Technical Report: A Methodology for Studying 802.11p VANET Broadcasting Performance with Practical Vehicle Distribution

0 	In a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), the performance of the communication protocol is influenced heavily by the vehicular density dynamics.
0 	However, most of the previous works on VANET performance modeling paid little attention to vehicle distribution, or simply assumed homogeneous car distribution.
0 	It is obvious that vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment due to traffic signals and speed limits at different portions of the road, as well as vehicle interactions that are significant on busy streets.
1 	In light of the inadequacy, we present in this paper an original methodology to study the broadcasting performance of 802.11p VANETs with practical vehicle distribution in urban environments.
1 	Firstly, we adopt the empirically verified stochastic traffic models, which incorporates the effect of urban settings (such as traffic lights and vehicle interactions) on car distribution and generates practical vehicular density profiles.
1 	Corresponding 802.11p protocol and performance models are then developed.
1 	When coupled with the traffic models, they can predict broadcasting efficiency, delay, as well as throughput performance of 802.11p VANETs based on the knowledge of car density at each location on the road.
1 	Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the accuracy of the developed mathematical models with the consideration of vehicle interaction.
2 	In general, our results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology on modeling protocol performance in practical signalized road networks, and shed insights into the design and development of future communication protocols and networking functions for VANETs.

## A General Model for MAC Protocol Selection in Wireless Sensor Networks

0 	Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being deployed for different applications, each having its own structure, goals and requirements.
0 	Medium access control (MAC) protocols play a significant role in WSNs and hence should be tuned to the applications.
0	However, there is no for selecting MAC protocols for different situations.
0 	Therefore, it is hard to decide which MAC protocol is good for a given situation.
0 	Having a precise model for each MAC protocol, on the other hand, is almost impossible.
0 	Using the intuition that the protocols in the same behavioral category perform similarly, our goal in this paper is to introduce a general model that selects the protocol(s) that satisfy the given requirements from the category that performs better for a given context.
1 	We define the Combined Performance Function (CPF) to demonstrate the performance of different categories protocols for different contexts.
1 	Having the general model, we then discuss the model scalability for adding new protocols, categories, requirements, and performance criteria.
1 	Considering energy consumption and delay as the initial performance criteria of the model, we focus on deriving mathematical models for them.
2 	The results extracted from CPF are the same as the well-known rule of thumb for the MAC protocols that verifies our model.
1 	We validate our models with the help of simulation study.
1 	We also implemented the current CPF model in a web page to make the model online and useful.

## Physical-Layer Network Coding: Tutorial, Survey, and Beyond

0 	The concept of physical-layer network coding (PNC) was proposed in 2006 for application in wireless networks.
0 	Since then it has developed into a subfield of network coding with wide followings.
0 	The basic idea of PNC is to exploit the network coding operation that occurs naturally when electromagnetic (EM) waves are superimposed on one another.
0 	This simple idea turns out to have profound and fundamental ramifications.
0 	Subsequent works by various researchers have led to many new results in the domains of 1) wireless communication; 2) wireless information theory; and 3) wireless networking.
0	The purpose of this paper is fourfold.
1 	First, we give a brief tutorial on the basic concept of PNC.
1 	Second, we survey and discuss recent key results in the three aforementioned areas.
1 	Third, we examine a critical issue in PNC: synchronization.
0 	It has been a common belief that PNC requires tight synchronization.
0 	Our recent results suggest, however, that PNC may actually benefit from asynchrony.
1 	Fourth, we propose that PNC is not just for wireless networks; it can also be useful in optical networks.
1 	We provide an example showing that the throughput of a passive optical network (PON) could potentially be raised by 100% with PNC.

## Optimum Sleep-Wake Scheduling of Sensors for Quickest Event Detection in Small Extent Wireless Sensor Networks

1 	We consider the problem of quickest event detection with sleep-wake scheduling in small extent wireless sensor networks in which, at each time slot, each sensor node in the awake state observes a sample and communicates the information to the fusion centre.
0 	The sensor nodes in the sleep state do not sample or communicate any information to the fusion centre (FC), thereby conserving energy.
0 	At each time slot, the FC, after having received the samples from the sensor nodes in the wake state, makes a decision to stop (and thus declare that the event has occurred) or to continue observing.
0 	If it decides to continue, the FC also makes the decision of choosing the number of sensor nodes to be in the wake state in the next time slot.
1 	We consider three alternative approaches to the problem of choosing the number of sensor nodes to be in the wake state in time slot k+1, based on the information available at time slot k, namely, 
1 	1.optimal control of M_{k+1}, the number of sensor nodes to be in the awake state in time slot k+1, 
1 	2.optimal control of q_{k+1}, the probability of a sensor node to be in the awake state in time slot k+1, and
1 	3.optimal probability q that a sensor node is in the awake state in any time slot.
2 	In each case, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process.
2 	We show that a sufficient statistic for the decision at time k is the a posteriori probability of change Pi_k.
2 	Also, we show that the optimal stopping rule is a threshold rule on Pi_k.
2	The optimal policy for M_{k+1} can keep very few sensors wake during the prechange phase and then quickly increase the number of sensors in the wake state when a change is "suspected".
2 	Among the three sleep-wake algorithms described, we observe that the total cost is minimum for the optimum control of M_{k+1} and is maximum for the optimum control on q.

## Tensor-Based Link Prediction in Intermittently Connected Wireless Networks

0 	Through several studies, it has been highlighted that mobility patterns in mobile networks are driven by human behaviors.
0 	This effect has been particularly observed in intermittently connected networks like DTN (Delay Tolerant Networks).
0 	Given that common social intentions generate similar human behavior, it is relevant to exploit this knowledge in the network protocols design, e.g. to identify the closeness degree between two nodes.
1 	In this paper, we propose a temporal link prediction technique for DTN which quantifies the behavior similarity between each pair of nodes and makes use of it to predict future links.
0 	Our prediction method keeps track of the spatio-temporal aspects of nodes behaviors organized as a third-order tensor that aims to records the evolution of the network topology.
1 	After collapsing the tensor information, we compute the degree of similarity for each pair of nodes using the Katz measure.
0 	This metric gives us an indication on the link occurrence between two nodes relying on their closeness.
1 	We show the efficiency of this method by applying it on three mobility traces: two real traces and one synthetic trace.
1 	Through several simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique regarding another approach based on a similarity metric used in DTN.
0 	The validity of this method is proven when the computation of score is made in a distributed way (i.e. with local information).
2 	We attest that the tensor-based technique is effective for temporal link prediction applied to the intermittently connected networks.
2 	Furthermore, we think that this technique can go beyond the realm of DTN and we believe this can be further applied on every case of figure in which there is a need to derive the underlying social structure of a network of mobile users.

## Vehicular Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks; Principles and Challenges

0 	The rapid increase of vehicular traffic and congestion on the highways began hampering the safe and efficient movement of traffic.
0 	Consequently, year by year, we see the ascending rate of car accidents and casualties in most of the countries.
0 	Therefore, exploiting the new technologies, e.g. wireless sensor networks, is required as a solution of reduction of these saddening and reprehensible statistics.
0 	This has motivated us to propose a novel and comprehensive system to utilize Wireless Sensor Networks for vehicular networks.
1 	We coin the vehicular network employing wireless Sensor networks as Vehicular Ad Hoc and Sensor Network, or VASNET in short.
1 	The proposed VASNET is particularly for highway traffic.
1	VASNET is a self-organizing Ad Hoc and sensor network comprised of a large number of sensor nodes.
1 	In VASNET there are two kinds of sensor nodes, some are embedded on the vehicles-vehicular nodes- and others are deployed in predetermined distances besides the highway road, known as Road Side Sensor nodes (RSS).
1 	The vehicular nodes are used to sense the velocity of the vehicle for instance.
1 	We can have some Base Stations (BS) such as Police Traffic Station, Firefighting Group and Rescue Team.
1 	The base stations may be stationary or mobile.
2 	VASNET provides capability of wireless communication between vehicular nodes and stationary nodes, to increase safety and comfort for vehicles on the highway roads.
2 	In this paper we explain main fundamentals and challenges of VASNET.

## Geographic Trough Filling for Internet Datacenters

0 	To reduce datacenter energy consumption and cost, current practice has considered demand-proportional resource provisioning schemes, where servers are turned on/off according to the load of requests.
0 	Most existing work considers instantaneous (Internet) requests only, which are explicitly or implicitly assumed to be delay-sensitive.
0 	On the other hand, in datacenters, there exist a vast amount of delay-tolerant jobs, such as background/maintainance jobs.
1 	In this paper, we explicitly differentiate delay-sensitive jobs and delay tolerant jobs.
1 	We focus on the problem of using delay-tolerant jobs to fill the extra capacity of datacenters, referred to as trough/valley filling.
1 	Giving a higher priority to delay-sensitive jobs, our schemes complement to most existing demand-proportional resource provisioning schemes.
1 	Our goal is to design intelligent trough filling mechanisms that are energy efficient and also achieve good delay performance.
1 	Specifically, we propose two joint dynamic speed scaling and traffic shifting schemes, one subgradient-based and the other queue-based.
1 	Our schemes assume little statistical information of the system, which is usually difficult to obtain in practice.
1 	In both schemes, energy cost saving comes from dynamic speed scaling, statistical multiplexing, electricity price diversity, and service efficiency diversity.
1 	In addition, good delay performance is achieved in the queue-based scheme via load shifting and capacity allocation based on queue conditions.
1 	Practical issues that may arise in datacenter networks are considered, including capacity and bandwidth constraint, service agility constraint, and load shifting cost.
2 	We use both artificial and real datacenter traces to evaluate the proposed schemes.

## P2P Domain Classification using Decision Tree

0 	In Peer-to-Peer context, a challenging problem is how to find the appropriate peer to deal with a given query without overly consuming bandwidth?
0 	Different methods proposed routing strategies of queries taking into account the P2P network at hand.
1 	This paper considers an unstructured P2P system based on an organization of peers around Super-Peers that are connected to Super-Super- Peer according to their semantic domains; By analyzing the queries log file, a predictive model that avoids flooding queries in the P2P network is constructed after predicting the appropriate Super-Peer, and hence the peer to answer the query.
0 	A challenging problem in a schema-based Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system is how to locate peers that are relevant to a given query.
1 	In this paper, architecture, based on (Super-)Peers is proposed, focusing on query routing.
1 	The approach to be implemented, groups together (Super-)Peers that have similar interests for an efficient query routing method.
1 	In such groups, called Super-Super-Peers (SSP), Super-Peers submit queries that are often processed by members of this group.
1 	A SSP is a specific Super-Peer which contains knowledge about: 1.its Super-Peers and 2.The other SSP.
1 	Knowledge is extracted by using data mining techniques (e.g. Decision Tree algorithms) starting from queries of peers that transit on the network.
2 	The advantage of this distributed knowledge is that, it avoids making semantic mapping between heterogeneous data sources owned by (Super-)Peers, each time the system decides to route query to other (Super-) Peers.
2 	The set of SSP improves the robustness in queries routing mechanism, and the scalability in P2P Network.
2 	Compared with a baseline approach,the proposal architecture shows the effect of the data mining with better performance in respect to response time and precision.

## Enabling Adaptive Rate and Relay Selection for 802.11 Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

0 	Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-configuring wireless networks that lack permanent infrastructure and are formed among mobile nodes on demand.
0 	Rapid node mobility results in dramatic channel variation, or fading, that degrades MANET performance.
0 	Employing channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter can improve the throughput of routing and medium access control (MAC) protocols for mobile ad hoc networks.
0 	Several routing algorithms in the literature explicitly incorporate the fading signal strength into the routing metric, thus selecting the routes with strong channel conditions.
0 	While these studies show that adaptation to the time-variant channel gain is beneficial in MANETs, they do not address the effect of the outdated fading CSI at the transmitter.
0 	For realistic mobile node speeds, the channel gain is rapidly varying, and becomes quickly outdated due the feedback delay.
1 	We analyze the link throughput of joint rate adaptation and adaptive relay selection in the presence of imperfect CSI.
1 	Moreover, for an 802.11 network that employs geographic opportunistic routing with adaptive rate and relay selection, we propose a novel method to reduce the effect of the feedback delay at the MAC layer in the presence of Rayleigh fading.
1 	This method exploits channel reciprocity and fading prediction and does not require significant modification to the existing 802.11 frame structure.
2 	Extensive network simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio for high mobile velocities relative to previously proposed approaches that employ outdated CSI at the transmitter.

## Noise Analysis and Detection Based on RF Energy Duration in wireless LAN

0 	Noise is the major problem while working with wireless LAN.
1 	In this paper we analyze the noise by using active receiving antenna and also propose the detection mechanism based on RF energy duration.
0 	The standard back off mechanism of 802.11 wireless LAN (WLAN) increases the contention window when a transmission failure occurs in order to alleviate contentions in a WLAN.
0 	In addition, many proposed schemes for 802.11 WLAN behave adaptively to transmission failures.
0 	Transmission failures in WLANs occur mostly by two causes: collision and channel noise.
0 	However, in 802.11 WLAN, a station cannot know the cause of a transmission failure, thus the adaptive schemes assume the ideal situation in which all transmission failures occur by only one of two causes.
0 	For this reason, they may behave erroneously in a real world where transmission failures occur by both causes.
1 	In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to detect collision, which utilizes transmission time information and RF energy duration on the channel.
2 	By detecting collisions, a station can differentiate the causes of transmission failures and the adaptive schemes can operate correctly by using the detection information.

## A Security Architecture for Data Aggregation and Access Control in Smart Grids

1 	We solve this problem of access control using cryptographic technique of attribute-based encryption.
1 	RTUs and users have attributes and cryptographic keys distributed by several key distribution centers (KDC).
1 	RTUs send data encrypted under a set of attributes.
1 	Users can decrypt information provided they have valid attributes.
1 	The access control scheme is distributed in nature and does not rely on a single KDC to distribute keys.
0 	Bobba \emph{et al.}\cite{BKAA09} proposed an access control scheme, which relies on a centralized KDC and is thus prone to single-point failure.
0 	The other requirement is that the KDC has to be online, during data transfer which is not required in our scheme.
1 	Our access control scheme is collusion resistant, meaning that users cannot collude and gain access to data, when they are not authorized to access.

2 	To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work on smart grids, which integrates these two important security components (privacy preserving data aggregation and access control) and presents an overall security architecture in smart grids.

## 1-D Coordinate Based on Local Information for MAC and Routing Issues in WSNs

0 	More and more critical Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) applications are emerging.
0 	Those applications need reliability and respect of time constraints.
0 	The underlying mechanisms such as MAC and routing must handle such requirements.
1	Our approach to the time constraint problem is to bound the hop-count between a node and the sink and the time it takes to do a hop so the end-to-end delay can be bounded and the communications are thus real-time.
1 	For reliability purpose we propose to select forwarder nodes depending on how they are connected in the direction of the sink.
1 	In order to be able to do so we need a coordinate (or a metric) that gives information on hop-count, that allows to strongly differentiate nodes and gives information on the connectivity of each node keeping in mind the intrinsic constraints of WSWs such as energy consumption, autonomy, etc.
1 	Due to the efficiency and scalability of greedy routing in WSNs and the financial cost of GPS chips, Virtual Coordinate Systems (VCSs) for WSNs have been proposed.
1 	A category of VCSs is based on the hop-count from the sink, this scheme leads to many nodes having the same coordinate.
1 	The main advantage of this system is that the hops number of a packet from a source to the sink is known.
1 	Nevertheless, it does not allow to differentiate the nodes with the same hop-count.
1 	In this report we propose a novel hop-count-based VCS which aims at classifying the nodes having the same hop-count depending on their connectivity and at differentiating nodes in a 2-hop neighborhood.
2 	Those properties make the coordinates, which also can be viewed as a local identifier, a very powerful metric which can be used in WSNs mechanisms.

1 	Consequently, we choose a proper frequency width of 0.1MHz and a relevantly reliable setting to apply one frequency several times.
1 	We make a few general assumptions to simplify real situation.
1 	For instance, immobile users yield to homogenous distribution; repeaters can receive and transmit information in any given frequency in duplex operation; coverage is mainly decided by antenna height.
1 	Two models are built up to solve 1000 users and 10000 users situations respectively.
1 	In order to utilize restricted frequency and PL code, three stratified terms - "cell", "cluster", "group" - are introduced to describe the models in detail.
2 	Under our analysis, 91 repeaters for 1000 users and 469 repeaters for 10000 users are viable results.
1 	Next, to test stability and sensitivity of models, we give total consideration to the variation of sum of users, antenna height, and frequency width and service radius.
2 	Evaluation about models is offered qualitatively.
2 	Finally, two practical cases are put forward to gain a partial knowledge of mountainous area.
2 	The brief method in dealing with mountains is classified discussion in two ideal conditions.
2	It may provide some constructive suggestions to avoid shortcomings or take proper measures in similar locations.

## Coded Path Protection: Efficient Conversion of Sharing to Coding

2 	Simulation results confirm that the CPP is significantly faster than the SPP and p-cycle techniques.
2 	CPP incurs marginal extra capacity on top of SPP.
2 	Its capacity efficiency is lower than the p-cycle technique for dense networks but can be higher for sparse networks.
2 	In addition, unlike p-cycle protection, CPP is inherently suitable for the wavelength continuity constraint in optical networks.

## Towards MAC/Anycast Diversity in IEEE 802.11n MIMO Networks

0 	Opportunistic Routing (OR) is a novel routing technique for wireless mesh networks that exploits the broadcast nature of the wireless medium.
0 	OR combines frames from multiple receivers and therefore creates a form of Spatial Diversity, called MAC Diversity.
0 	The gain from OR is especially high in networks where the majority of links has a high packet loss probability.
0 	The updated IEEE 802.11n standard improves the physical layer with the ability to use multiple transmit and receive antennas, i.e. Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO), and therefore already offers spatial diversity on the physical layer, i.e. called Physical Diversity, which improves the reliability of a wireless link by reducing its error rate.
1 	In this paper we quantify the gain from MAC diversity as utilized by OR in the presence of PHY diversity as provided by a MIMO system like 802.11n.
1 	We experimented with an IEEE 802.11n indoor testbed and analyzed the nature of packet losses.
2 	Our experiment results show negligible MAC diversity gains for both interference-prone 2.4 GHz and interference-free 5 GHz channels when using 802.11n.
2 	This is different to the observations made with single antenna systems based on 802.11b/g, as well as in initial studies with 802.11n.
