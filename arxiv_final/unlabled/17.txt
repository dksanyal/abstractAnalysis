## Enhanced Random Access and Beam Training for mmWave Wireless Local Networks with High User Density

-1 	As low frequency band becomes more and more crowded, millimeter-wave (mmWave) has attracted significant attention recently.
-1 	IEEE has released the 802.
-1 	11ad standard to satisfy the demand of ultra-high-speed communication.
-1 	It adopts beamforming technology that can generate directional beams to compensate for high path loss.
-1 	In the Association Beamforming Training (A-BFT) phase of beamforming (BF) training, a station (STA) randomly selects an A-BFT slot to contend for training opportunity.
-1 	Due to the limited number of A-BFT slots, A-BFT phase suffers high probability of collisions in dense user scenarios, resulting in inefficient training performance.
-1 	Based on the evaluation of the IEEE 802.
-1 	11ad standard and 802.
-1 	11ay draft in dense user scenarios of mmWave wireless networks, we propose an enhanced A-BFT beam training and random access mechanism, including the Separated A-BFT (SA-BFT) and Secondary Backoff A-BFT (SBA-BFT).
-1 	The SA-BFT can provide more A-BFT slots and divide A-BFT slots into two regions by defining a new `E-A-BFT Length' field compared to the legacy 802.
-1 	11ad A-BFT, thereby maintaining compatibility when 802.
-1 	11ay devices are mixed with 802.
-1 	11ad devices.
-1 	It can also reduce the collision probability in dense user scenarios greatly.
-1 	The SBA-BFT performs secondary backoff with very small overhead of transmission opportunities within one A-BFT slot, which not only further reduces collision probability, but also improves the A-BFT slots utilization.
-1 	Furthermore, we propose a three-dimensional Markov model to analyze the performance of the SBA-BFT.
-1 	The analytical and simulation results show that both the SA-BFT and the SBA-BFT can significantly improve BF training efficiency, which are beneficial to the optimization design of dense user wireless networks based on the IEEE 802.

## A Scalable Approach for Service Chain (SC) Mapping with Multiple SC Instances in a Wide-Area Network

-1 	Network Function Virtualization (NFV) aims to simplify deployment of network services by running Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on commercial off-the-shelf servers.
-1 	Service deployment involves placement of VNFs and in-sequence routing of traffic flows through VNFs comprising a Service Chain (SC).
-1 	The joint VNF placement and traffic routing is called SC mapping.
-1 	In a Wide-Area Network (WAN), a situation may arise where several traffic flows, generated by many distributed node pairs, require the same SC; then, a single instance (or occurrence) of that SC might not be enough.
-1 	SC mapping with multiple SC instances for the same SC turns out to be a very complex problem, since the sequential traversal of VNFs has to be maintained while accounting for traffic flows in various directions.
-1 	Our study is the first to deal with the problem of SC mapping with multiple SC instances to minimize network resource consumption.
-1 	We first propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to solve this problem.
-1 	Since ILP does not scale to large networks, we develop a column-generation-based ILP (CG-ILP) model.
-1 	However, we find that exact mathematical modeling of the problem results in quadratic constraints in our CG-ILP.
-1 	The quadratic constraints are made linear but even the scalability of CG-ILP is limited.
-1 	Hence, we also propose a two-phase column-generation-based approach to get results over large network topologies within reasonable computational times.
-1 	Using such an approach, we observe that an appropriate choice of only a small set of SC instances can lead to a solution very close to the minimum bandwidth consumption.
-1 	Further, this approach also helps us to analyze the effects of number of VNF replicas and number of NFV nodes on bandwidth consumption when deploying these minimum number of SC instances.

## The Internet Pendulum: On the periodicity of Internet Topology Measurements

-1 	Public databases of large-scale topology measures (e.
-1 	g.
-1 	RIPE Atlas) are very popular both in the research and in the practitioners communities.
-1 	They are used, at least, for understanding the state of the Internet in real time, for outage detection, and to get a broad baseline view of the Internet evolution over time.
-1 	However, despite the large amount of investigations, the dynamic aspects of these measures have not been fully understood.
-1 	As an example, looking at time-series of such measures, patterns that repeat at regular intervals.
-1 	More specifically, looking at a time-series of traceroutes involving certain source-target pairs it happens to observe that the paths follow alternations that repeat several times.
-1 	Have they the features of periodicity?
-1 	What are their main characteristics?
-1 	In this paper we study the problem of detecting and characterizing periodicities in Internet topology measures.
-1 	For this purpose we devise an algorithm based on autocorrelation and string matching.
-1 	First, we validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in-vitro, on randomly generated measures containing artificial periodicities.
-1 	Second, we exploit the algorithm to verify how frequently traceroute sequences extracted from popular databases of topology measures exhibit a periodic behavior.
-1 	We show that a surprisingly high percentage of measures present one or more periodicities.
-1 	This happens both with traceroutes performed at different frequencies and with different types of traceroutes.
-1 	Third, we apply our algorithm to databases of BGP updates, a context where periodicities are even more unexpected than the one of traceroutes.
-1 	Also in this case our algorithm is able to spot periodicities.
-1 	We argue that some of them are related to oscillations of the BGP control plane.

## A Load-Balanced Call Admission Controller for IMS Cloud Computing

-1 	Network functions virtualization provides opportunities to design, deploy, and manage networking services.
-1 	It utilizes cloud computing virtualization services that run on high-volume servers, switches, and storage hardware to virtualize network functions.
-1 	Virtualization techniques can be used in IP multimedia subsystem (IMS) cloud computing to develop different networking functions (e.g., load balancing and call admission control).
-1 	IMS network signaling happens through session initiation protocol (SIP).
-1 	An open issue is the control of overload that occurs when an SIP server lacks sufficient CPU and memory resources to process all messages.
-1 	This paper proposes a virtual load balanced call admission controller (VLB-CAC) for the cloud-hosted SIP servers.
-1 	VLB-CAC determines the optimal call admission rates and signaling paths for admitted calls along with the optimal allocation of CPU and memory resources of the SIP servers.
-1 	This optimal solution is derived through a new linear programming model.
-1 	This model requires some critical information of SIP servers as input.
-1 	Further, VLB-CAC is equipped with an autoscaler to overcome resource limitations.
-1 	The proposed scheme is implemented in smart applications on virtual infrastructure (SAVI) which serves as a virtual testbed.
-1 	An assessment of the numerical and experimental results demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed work.

## Network Link Dimensioning based on Statistical Analysis and Modeling of Real Internet Traffic

-1 	Link dimensioning is used by ISPs to properly provision the capacity of their network links.
-1 	Operators have to make provisions for sudden traffic bursts and network failures to assure uninterrupted operations.
-1 	In practice, traffic averages are used to roughly estimate required capacity.
-1 	More accurate solutions often require traffic statistics easily obtained from packet captures, e.g. variance.
-1 	Our investigations on real Internet traffic have emphasized that the traffic shows high variations at small aggregation times, which indicates that the traffic is self-similar and has a heavy-tailed characteristics.
-1 	Self-similarity and heavy-tailedness are of great importance for network capacity planning purposes.
-1 	Traffic modeling process should consider all Internet traffic characteristics.
-1 	Thereby, the quality of service (QoS) of the network would not affected by any mismatching between the real traffic properties and the reference statistical model.
-1 	This paper proposes a new class of traffic profiles that is better suited for metering bursty Internet traffic streams.
-1 	We employ bandwidth provisioning to determine the lowest required bandwidth capacity level for a network link, such that for a given traffic load, a desired performance target is met.
-1 	We validate our approach using packet captures from real IP-based networks.
-1 	The proposed link dimensioning approach starts by measuring the statistical parameters of the available traces, and then the degree of fluctuations in the traffic has been measured.
-1 	This is followed by choosing a proper model to fit the traffic such as lognormal and generalized extreme value distributions.
-1 	Finally, the optimal capacity for the link can be estimated by deploying the bandwidth provisioning approach.
-1 	It has been shown that the heavy tailed distributions give more precise values for the link capacity than the Gaussian model.

## Centralized Congestion Control and Scheduling in a Datacenter

-1 	We consider the problem of designing a packet-level congestion control and scheduling policy for datacenter networks.
-1 	Current datacenter networks primarily inherit the principles that went into the design of Internet, where congestion control and scheduling are distributed.
-1 	While distributed architecture provides robustness, it suffers in terms of performance.
-1 	Unlike Internet, data center is fundamentally a "controlled" environment.
-1 	This raises the possibility of designing a centralized architecture to achieve better performance.
-1 	Recent solutions such as Fastpass and Flowtune have provided the proof of this concept.
-1 	This raises the question: what is theoretically optimal performance achievable in a data center?
-1 	We propose a centralized policy that guarantees a per-flow end-to-end flow delay bound of $O$(#hops $\times$ flow-size $/$ gap-to-capacity).
-1 	Effectively such an end-to-end delay will be experienced by flows even if we removed congestion control and scheduling constraints as the resulting queueing networks can be viewed as the classical reversible multi-class queuing network, which has a product-form stationary distribution.
-1 	In the language of Harrison et al.,
-1 	we establish that baseline performance for this model class is achievable.
-1 	Indeed, as the key contribution of this work, we propose a method to emulate such a reversible queuing network while satisfying congestion control and scheduling constraints.
-1 	Precisely, our policy is an emulation of Store-and-Forward (SFA) congestion control in conjunction with Last-Come-First-Serve Preemptive-Resume (LCFS-PR) scheduling policy.

## Device-to-Device Load Balancing for Cellular Networks

-1 	Small-cell architecture is widely adopted by cellular network operators to increase network capacity.
-1 	By reducing the size of cells, operators can pack more (low-power) base stations in an area to better serve the growing demands, without causing extra interference.
-1 	However, this approach suffers from low spectrum temporal efficiency.
-1 	When a cell becomes smaller and covers fewer users, its total traffic fluctuates significantly due to insufficient traffic aggregation and exhibiting a large "peak-to-mean" ratio.
-1 	As operators customarily provision spectrum for peak traffic, large traffic temporal fluctuation inevitably leads to low spectrum temporal efficiency.
-1 	In this paper, we advocate device-to-device (D2D) load-balancing as a useful mechanism to address the fundamental drawback of small-cell architecture.
-1 	The idea is to shift traffic from a congested cell to its adjacent under-utilized cells by leveraging inter-cell D2D communication, so that the traffic can be served without using extra spectrum, effectively improving the spectrum temporal efficiency.
-1 	We provide theoretical modeling and analysis to characterize the benefit of D2D load balancing, in terms of total spectrum requirements of all individual cells.
-1 	We also derive the corresponding cost, in terms of incurred D2D traffic overhead.
-1 	We carry out empirical evaluations based on real-world 4G data traces to gauge the benefit and cost of D2D load balancing under practical settings.
-1 	The results show that D2D load balancing can reduce the spectrum requirement by 25% as compared to the standard scenario without D2D load balancing, at the expense of negligible 0.
-1 	7% D2D traffic overhead.

## Low Complexity Fair Scheduling in LTE Uplink Involving Different Traffic Classes

-1 	Long term evolution (LTE) has already been accepted as the de-facto 4G wireless technology.
-1 	However, the bulk of the research on LTE packet scheduling is concentrated in the downlink and the uplink is comparatively less explored.
-1 	In uplink, mostly channel aware scheduling with throughput maximization has been studied.
-1 	Further, channel aware scheduling requires an infinitely backlogged buffer model.
-1 	This makes the investigations unrealistic.
-1 	Therefore, in this work, we propose an LTE uplink packet scheduling procedure with a realistic traffic source.
-1 	Firstly, we advocate a joint channel and buffer aware algorithm, which seeks to maximize the actual number of bits transmitted once a user is scheduled.
-1 	Thereafter, we modify our algorithm to support traffic types with delay constraints.
-1 	Next, we enhance our algorithm to support multiple classes of traffic.
-1 	Finally, we have introduced priority flipping to minimize bandwidth starvation of lower priority traffics in presence of higher percentage of high priority traffic.
-1 	In all the proposals, we have replaced the delay constraint by minimizing the packet drop due to delay violation.
-1 	This further helps in reducing the problems to a well-known assignment problem.

## FlowCover: Low-cost Flow Monitoring Scheme in Software Defined Networks

-1 	Network monitoring and measurement are crucial in network management to facilitate quality of service routing and performance evaluation.
-1 	Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes network management easier by separating the control plane and data plane.
-1 	Network monitoring in SDN is lightweight as operators only need to install a monitoring module into the controller.
-1 	Active monitoring techniques usually introduce too many overheads into the network.
-1 	The state-of-the-art approaches utilize sampling method, aggregation flow statistics and passive measurement techniques to reduce overheads.
-1 	However, little work in literature has focus on reducing the communication cost of network monitoring.
-1 	Moreover, most of the existing approaches select the polling switch nodes by sub-optimal local heuristics.
-1 	Inspired by the visibility and central control of SDN, we propose FlowCover, a low-cost high-accuracy monitoring scheme to support various network management tasks.
-1 	We leverage the global view of the network topology and active flows to minimize the communication cost by formulating the problem as a weighted set cover, which is proved to be NP-hard.
-1 	Heuristics are presented to obtain the polling scheme efficiently and handle flow changes practically.
-1 	We build a simulator to evaluate the performance of FlowCover.
-1 	Extensive experiment results show that FlowCover reduces roughly 50% communication cost without loss of accuracy in most cases.

## CeMon: A Cost-effective Flow Monitoring System in Software Defined Networks

-1 	Network monitoring and measurement are crucial in network management to facilitate quality of service routing and performance evaluation.
-1 	Software Defined Networking (SDN) makes network management easier by separating the control plane and data plane.
-1 	Network monitoring in SDN is relatively light-weight since operators only need to install a monitoring module into the controller.

-1 	Moreover, most of the existing approaches select polling switch nodes by sub-optimal local heuristics.
-1 	Inspired by the visibility and central control of SDN, we propose CeMon, a generic low-cost high-accuracy monitoring system that supports various network management tasks.

-1 	The problem is formulated as a weighted set cover problem which is proved to be NP-hard.
-1 	Heuristics are presented to obtain the polling scheme efficiently and handle traffic dynamics practically.
-1 	In order to balance the cost and flexibility, an Adaptive Fine-grained Polling Scheme (AFPS) is proposed as a complementary method to implement flow level measurement tasks.
-1 	Three sampling algorithms are further proposed to eliminate measurement overhead while maintain high accuracy.
-1 	Both emulation and simulation results show that MCPS reduces more than 50% of the communication cost with negligible loss of accuracy for different topologies and traffics.
-1 	We also use real traces to demonstrate that AFPS reduces the cost by up to 20% with only 1.

## Internet Anomaly Detection based on Complex Network Path

-1 	Detecting the anomaly behaviors such as network failure or Internet intentional attack in the large-scale Internet is a vital but challenging task.
-1 	While numerous techniques have been developed based on Internet traffic in past years, anomaly detection for structured datasets by complex network have just been of focus recently.
-1 	In this paper, a anomaly detection method for large-scale Internet topology is proposed by considering the changes of network crashes.
-1 	In order to quantify the dynamic changes of Internet topology, the network path changes coefficient(NPCC) is put forward which will highlight the Internet abnormal state after it is attacked continuously.
-1 	Furthermore we proposed the decision function which is inspired by Fibonacci Sequence to determine whether the Internet is abnormal or not.
-1 	That is the current Internet is abnormal if its NPCC is beyond the normal domain which structured by the previous k NPCCs of Internet topology.
-1 	Finally the new Internet anomaly detection method was tested over the topology data of three Internet anomaly events.
-1 	The results show that the detection accuracy of all events are over 97%, the detection precision of each event are 90.
-1 	24%, 83.
-1 	33% and 66.
-1 	67%, when k = 36.
-1 	According to the experimental values of the index F_1, we found the the better the detection performance is, the bigger the k is, and our method has better performance for the anomaly behaviors caused by network failure than that caused by intentional attack.
-1 	Compared with traditional anomaly detection, our work may be more simple and powerful for the government or organization in items of detecting large-scale abnormal events.

## Towards efficient coexistence of IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH and IEEE 802.11

## Collaborative Spatial Reuse in Wireless Networks via Selfish Multi-Armed Bandits

-1 	Next-generation wireless deployments are characterized by being dense and uncoordinated, which often leads to inefficient use of resources and poor performance.
-1 	To solve this, we envision the utilization of completely decentralized mechanisms to enable Spatial Reuse (SR).
-1 	In particular, we focus on dynamic channel selection and Transmission Power Control (TPC).
-1 	We rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL), and more specifically on Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs), to allow networks to learn their best configuration.
-1 	In this work, we study the exploration-exploitation trade-off by means of the $\varepsilon$-greedy, EXP3, UCB and Thompson sampling action-selection, and compare their performance.
-1 	In addition, we study the implications of selecting actions simultaneously in an adversarial setting (i.e., concurrently), and compare it with a sequential approach.
-1 	Our results show that optimal proportional fairness can be achieved, even when no information about neighboring networks is available to the learners and Wireless Networks (WNs) operate selfishly.
-1 	However, there is high temporal variability in the throughput experienced by the individual networks, specially for $\varepsilon$-greedy and EXP3.
-1 	These strategies, contrary to UCB and Thompson sampling, base their operation on the absolute experienced reward, rather than on its distribution.
-1 	We identify the cause of this variability to be the adversarial setting of our setup in which the set of most played actions provide intermittent good/poor performance depending on the neighboring decisions.
-1 	We also show that learning sequentially, even if using a selfish strategy, contributes to minimize this variability.
-1 	The sequential approach is therefore shown to effectively deal with the challenges posed by the adversarial settings that are typically found in decentralized WNs.

## An Energy-Aware WLAN Discovery Scheme for LTE HetNet

-1 	Recently, there has been significant interest in the integration and co-existence of Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) with other Radio Access Technologies, like IEEE 802.

-1 	Although, the inter-working of IEEE 802.
-1 	11 WLANs with 3GPP LTE has indicated enhanced network performance in the context of capacity and load balancing, the WLAN discovery scheme implemented in most of the commercially available smartphones is very inefficient and results in high battery drainage.

-1 	We have implemented various discovery schemes in Android framework, to evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme against other solutions in the literature.
-1 	Since, Android does not support selective scanning mode, we have implemented modules in Android to enable selective scanning.
-1 	Further, we have also used simulation studies and justified the results using power consumption modeling.
-1 	The results from the field experiments and simulations have shown high power savings using the proposed scanning scheme without any discovery performance deterioration.
