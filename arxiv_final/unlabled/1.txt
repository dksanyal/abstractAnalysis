## A Delay Based Approach for Congestion Avoidance in Interconnected Heterogeneous Computer Networks

-1 	In heterogeneous networks, achieving congestion avoidance is difficult because the congestion feedback from one subnetwork may have no meaning to source on other other subnetworks.
-1 	We propose using changes in round-trip delay as an implicit feedback.
-1 	Using a black-box model of the network, we derive an expression for the optimal window as a function of the gradient of the delay-window curve.
-1 	The problems of selfish optimum and social optimum are also addressed.
-1 	It is shown that without a careful design, it is possible to get into a race condition during heavy congestion, where each user wants more resources than others, thereby leading to a diverging congestion   It is shown that congestion avoidance using round trip delay is a promising approach.
-1 	The aproach has the advantage that there is absolutely no overhead for the network itself.
-1 	It is exemplified by a simple scheme.
-1 	The performance of the scheme is analyzed using a simulation model.
-1 	The scheme is shown to be efficient, fair, convergent and adaptive to changes in network configuration.
-1 	The scheme as described works only for networks that can ne modelled with queueing servers with constant service times.
-1 	Further research is required to extend it for implementation in practical networks.
-1 	Several directions for future research have beensuggested.

## Congestion Avoidance in Computer Networks with a Connectionless Network Layer, Part I: Concepts, Goals and Methodology

-1 	Congestion is said to occur in the network when the resource demands exceed the capacity and packets are lost due to too much queuing in the network.
-1 	During congestion, the network throughput may drop to zero and the path delay may become very high.
-1 	A congestion control scheme helps the network to recover from the congestion state.
-1 	A congestion avoidance scheme allows a network to operate in the region of low delay and high throughput.
-1 	Such schemes prevent a network from entering the congested state.
-1 	Congestion avoidance is a prevention mechanism while congestion control is a recovery mechanism.
-1 	We compare the concept of congestion avoidance with that of flow control and congestion control.
-1 	A number of possible alternative for congestion avoidance have been identified.
-1 	From these a few were selected for study.
-1 	The criteria for selection and goals for these schemes have been described.
-1 	In particular, we wanted the scheme to be globally efficient, fair, dynamic, convergent, robust, distributed, configuration independent, etc.
-1 	These goals and the test cases used to verify whether a particular scheme has met the goals have been described.
-1 	We model the network and the user policies for congestion avoidance as a feedback control system.
-1 	The key components of a generic congestion avoidance scheme are: congestion detection, congestion feedback, feedback selector, signal filter, decision function, and increase/decrease algorithms.
-1 	These components have been explained.

## The Design and Analysis of Virtual Network Configuration for a Wireless Mobile ATM Network

-1 	This research concentrates on the design and analysis of an algorithm referred to as Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) which uses predicted future states of a system for faster network configuration and management.
-1 	VNC is applied to the configuration of a wireless mobile ATM network.
-1 	VNC is built on techniques from parallel discrete event simulation merged with constraints from real-time systems and applied to mobile ATM configuration and handoff.
-1 	Configuration in a mobile network is a dynamic and continuous process.
-1 	Factors such as load, distance, capacity and topology are all constantly changing in a mobile environment.
-1 	The VNC algorithm anticipates configuration changes and speeds the reconfiguration process by pre-computing and caching results.
-1 	VNC propagates local prediction results throughout the VNC enhanced system.
-1 	The Global Positioning System is an enabling technology for the use of VNC in mobile networks because it provides location information and accurate time for each node.
-1 	This research has resulted in well defined structures for the encapsulation of physical processes within Logical Processes and a generic library for enhancing a system with VNC.
-1 	Enhancing an existing system with VNC is straight forward assuming the existing physical processes do not have side effects.
-1 	The benefit of prediction is gained at the cost of additional traffic and processing.
-1 	This research includes an analysis of VNC and suggestions for optimization of the VNC algorithm and its parameters.

## An Internet Multicast System for the Stock Market

-1 	We are moving toward a distributed, international, twenty-four hour, electronic stock exchange.
-1 	The exchange will use the global Internet, or internet technology.
-1 	This system is a natural application of multicast because there are a large number of receivers that should receive the same information simultaneously.
-1 	The data requirements for the stock exchange are discussed.
-1 	The current multicast protocols lack the reliability, fairness, and scalability needed in this application.
-1 	We describe a distributed architecture together with a reliable multicast protocol, a modification of the RMP protocol, that has characteristics appropriate for this application.
-1 	The architecture is used in three applications: In the first, we construct a unified stock ticker of the transactions that are being conducted on the various physical and electronic exchanges.
-1 	Our objective is to deliver the the same combined ticker reliably and simultaneously to all receivers, anywhere in the world.
-1 	In the second, we construct a unified sequence of buy and sell offers that are delivered to a single exchange or a collection of exchanges.
-1 	Our objective is to give all traders the same fair access to an exchange independent of their relative distances to the exchange or the loss characteristics of the international network.
-1 	In the third, we construct a distributed, electronic trading floor that can replace the current exchanges.
-1 	This application uses the innovations from the first two applications to combine their fairness attributes.

## State Analysis and Aggregation Study for Multicast-based Micro Mobility

-1 	IP mobility addresses the problem of changing the network point-of-attachment transparently during movement.
-1 	Mobile IP is the proposed standard by IETF.
-1 	Several studies, however, have shown that Mobile IP has several drawbacks, such as triangle routing and poor handoff performance.
-1 	Multicast-based mobility has been proposed as a promising solution to the above problems, incurring less end-to-end delays and fast smooth handoff.
-1 	Nonetheless, such architecture suffers from multicast state scalability problems with the growth in number of mobile nodes.
-1 	This architecture also requires ubiquitous multicast deployment and more complex security measures.
-1 	To alleviate these problems, we propose an intra-domain multicast-based mobility solution.
-1 	A mobility proxy allocates a multicast address for each mobile that moves to its domain.
-1 	The mobile uses this multicast address within a domain for micro mobility.
-1 	Also, aggregation is considered to reduce the multicast state.
-1 	We conduct multicast state analysis to study the efficiency of several aggregation techniques.
-1 	We use extensive simulation to evaluate our protocol's performance over a variety of real and generated topologies.
-1 	We take aggregation gain as metric for our evaluation.
-1 	Our simulation results show that in general leaky aggregation obtains better gains than perfect aggregation.
-1 	Also, we notice that aggregation gain increases with the increase in number of visiting mobile nodes and with the decrease in number of mobility proxies within a domain.

## Contact-Based Architecture for Resource Discovery (CARD) in Large Scale MANets

-1 	In this paper we propose a novel architecture, CARD, for resource discovery in large scale Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANets) which, may scale up to thousands of nodes and may span wide geographical regions.
-1 	Unlike previously proposed schemes, our architecture avoids expensive mechanisms such as global flooding as well as complex coordination between nodes to form a hierarchy.
-1 	CARD is also independent of any external source of information such as GPS.
-1 	In our architecture nodes within a limited number of hops from each node form the neighborhood of that node.
-1 	Resources within the neighborhood can be readily accessed with the help of a proactive scheme within the neighborhood.
-1 	For accessing resources beyond the neighborhood, each node also maintains a few distant nodes called contacts.
-1 	Contacts help in creating a small world in the network and provide an efficient way to query for resources beyond the neighborhood.
-1 	As the number of contacts of a node increases, the network view (reachability) of the node increases.
-1 	Paths to contacts are validated periodically to adapt to mobility.
-1 	We present mechanisms for contact selection and maintenance that attempt to increase reachability while minimizing overhead.
-1 	Our simulation results show a clear trade-off between increase in reachability on one hand, and contact selection and maintenance overhead on the other.
-1 	Our results suggest that CARD can be configured to provide a desirable reachability distribution for different network sizes.
-1 	Comparisons with other schemes for resource discovery, such as flooding and bordercasting, show our architecture to be much more efficient and scalable.

## Efficient Micro-Mobility using Intra-domain Multicast-based Mechanisms (M&M)

-1 	One of the most important metrics in the design of IP mobility protocols is the handover performance.
-1 	The current Mobile IP (MIP) standard has been shown to exhibit poor handover performance.
-1 	Most other work attempts to modify MIP to slightly improve its efficiency, while others propose complex techniques to replace MIP.
-1 	Rather than taking these approaches, we instead propose a new architecture for providing efficient and smooth handover, while being able to co-exist and inter-operate with other technologies.
-1 	Specifically, we propose an intra-domain multicast-based mobility architecture, where a visiting mobile is assigned a multicast address to use while moving within a domain.
-1 	Efficient handover is achieved using standard multicast join/prune mechanisms.
-1 	Two approaches are proposed and contrasted.
-1 	The first introduces the concept proxy-based mobility, while the other uses algorithmic mapping to obtain the multicast address of visiting mobiles.
-1 	We show that the algorithmic mapping approach has several advantages over the proxy approach, and provide mechanisms to support it.
-1 	Network simulation (using NS-2) is used to evaluate our scheme and compare it to other routing-based micro-mobility schemes - CIP and HAWAII.
-1 	The proactive handover results show that both M&M and CIP shows low handoff delay and packet reordering depth as compared to HAWAII.
-1 	The reason for M&M's comparable performance with CIP is that both use bi-cast in proactive handover.
-1 	The M&M, however, handles multiple border routers in a domain, where CIP fails.
-1 	We also provide a handover algorithm leveraging the proactive path setup capability of M&M, which is expected to outperform CIP in case of reactive handover.

## Gossip Based Ad-Hoc Routing

-1 	Many ad hoc routing protocols are based on some variant of flooding.
-1 	Despite various optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily.
-1 	We propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with some probability, to reduce the overhead of the routing protocols.
-1 	Gossiping exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions, the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node gets the message; in the remaining executions, a substantial fraction of the nodes gets the message.
-1 	The fraction of executions in which most nodes get the message depends on the gossiping probability and the topology of the network.
-1 	In the networks we have considered, using gossiping probability between 0.
-1 	6 and 0.
-1 	8 suffices to ensure that almost every node gets the message in almost every execution.
-1 	For large networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35% fewer messages than flooding, with improved performance.
-1 	Gossiping can also be combined with various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits.
-1 	Simulations show that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement, even in networks as small as 150 nodes.
-1 	We expect that the improvement should be even more significant in larger networks.

## Efficient Algorithms for Large-Scale Topology Discovery

-1 	There is a growing interest in discovery of internet topology at the interface level.
-1 	A new generation of highly distributed measurement systems is currently being deployed.
-1 	Unfortunately, the research community has not examined the problem of how to perform such measurements efficiently and in a network-friendly manner.
-1 	In this paper we make two contributions toward that end.
-1 	First, we show that standard topology discovery methods (e.g., skitter) are quite inefficient, repeatedly probing the same interfaces.
-1 	This is a concern, because when scaled up, such methods will generate so much traffic that they will begin to resemble DDoS attacks.
-1 	We measure two kinds of redundancy in probing (intra- and inter-monitor) and show that both kinds are important.
-1 	We show that straightforward approaches to addressing these two kinds of redundancy must take opposite tacks, and are thus fundamentally in conflict.
-1 	Our second contribution is to propose and evaluate Doubletree, an algorithm that reduces both types of redundancy simultaneously on routers and end systems.
-1 	The key ideas are to exploit the tree-like structure of routes to and from a single point in order to guide when to stop probing, and to probe each path by starting near its midpoint.
-1 	Our results show that Doubletree can reduce both types of measurement load on the network dramatically, while permitting discovery of nearly the same set of nodes and links.
-1 	We then show how to enable efficient communication between monitors through the use of Bloom filters.

## Deployment in dynamic environments

-1 	Information and communication technologies are moving towards a new stage where applications will be dynamically deployed, uninstalled, updated and (re)configured.
-1 	Several approaches have been followed with the goal of creating a fully automated and context-aware deployment system.
-1 	Ideally, this system should be capable of handling the dynamics of this new situation, without losing sight of other factors, such as performance, security, availability or scalability.
-1 	We will take some of the technologies that follow the principles of Service Oriented Architectures, SOA, as a paradigm of dynamic environments.
-1 	SOA promote the breaking down of applications into sets of loosely coupled elements, called services.
-1 	Services can be dynamically bound, deployed, reconfigured, uninstalled and updated.
-1 	First of all, we will try to offer a broad view on the specific deployment issues that arise in these environments.
-1 	Later on, we will present our approach to the problem.
-1 	One of the essential points that has to be tackled to develop an automated deployment engine will be to have enough information to carry out tasks without human intervention.

## Data Path Processing in Fast Programmable Routers

-1 	Internet is growing at a fast pace.
-1 	The link speeds are surging toward 40 Gbps with the emergence of faster link technologies.
-1 	New applications are coming up which require intelligent processing at the intermediate routers.
-1 	Switches and routers are becoming the bottlenecks in fast communication.
-1 	On one hand faster links deliver more packets every second and on the other hand intelligent processing consumes more CPU cycles at the router.
-1 	The conflicting goals of providing faster but computationally expensive processing call for new approaches in designing routers.
-1 	This survey takes a look at the core functionalities, like packet classification, buffer memory management, switch scheduling and output link scheduling performed by a router in its data path processing and discusses the algorithms that aim to reduce the performance bound for these operations.
-1 	An important requirement for the routers is to provide Quality of Service guarantees.
-1 	We propose an algorithm to guarantee QoS in Input Queued Routers.
-1 	The hardware solution to speed up router operation was Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs).
-1 	But the inherent inflexibility of the method is a demerit as network standards and application requirements are constantly evolving, which seek a faster turnaround time to keep up with the changes.
-1 	The promise of Network Processors (NP) is the flexibility of general-purpose processors together with the speed of ASICs.
-1 	We will study the architectural choices for the design of Network Processors and focus on some of the commercially available NPs.
-1 	There is a plethora of NP vendors in the market.

## Supporting Bandwidth Guarantee and Mobility for Real-Time Applications on Wireless LANs

-1 	The proliferation of IEEE 802.
-1 	11-based wireless LANs opens up avenues for creation of several tetherless and mobility oriented services.
-1 	Most of these services, like voice over WLAN, media streaming etc.,
-1 	generate delay and bandwidth sensitive traffic.

## On the Effect of Fading on Ad hoc Networking

-1 	Most MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork) research assumes idealized propagation models.
-1 	Experimental results have shown significant divergence from simulation results due to the effect of signal fading in realistic wireless communication channels.
-1 	In this paper, we characterize the impact of fading on protocol performance.
-1 	We first study the effect of fading on MAC performance and show that its effect can be dominating.
-1 	One of our important conclusions is that eliminating RTS/CTS packets results in more effective operation under fading.
-1 	We also identify an unfairness problem that arises due to backoffs in the presence of fading.
-1 	Moreover, fading results in several subtle interactions between the MAC and routing layers.
-1 	We identify several of these problems and make observations about effective approaches for addressing them.
-1 	For example, the criteria for determining the best path should not only consider the link status but also the link order.
-1 	In addition, because routing protocols rely on MAC level transmission failure (when the retry limit is exceeded), route failure errors are often generated unnecessarily.
-1 	Finally, because MAC level broadcasts are unreliable, they are especially vulnerable to fading.
-1 	We analyze these effects and outline preliminary solutions to them.
