#### Inhibitory effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate on angiogenesis induced by human endometrial cancer.

OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate on angiogenesis induced by endometrial cancer and to elucidate the possible mechanisms by which it inhibits the growth of the cancer.
METHODS    				Tumors were obtained from 29 patients with endometrial adenocarcinoma, and angiogenesis was assayed in corneas of white rabbits.
RESULTS    				Transplantation of tumor tissues into rabbit corneas induced angiogenesis in 70.4% of the corneas, but their transplantation with a pellet of medroxyprogesterone acetate induced angiogenesis in only 21.5% of the corneas.
RESULTS    				This compound also inhibited angiogenesis induced by acidic fibroblast growth factor and transforming growth factor-alpha.
CONCLUSIONS				Inhibition of angiogenesis may be one mechanism by which medroxyprogesterone acetate inhibits the growth of endometrial adenocarcinoma, and its inhibition of neovascularization induced by adenocarcinoma may be through its direct action on endothelial cells.

#### Evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests in the detection of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity.

OBJECTIVE  				We sought to determine and compare the value of several rapid diagnostic tests in the detection of intraamniotic infection.
METHODS    				Gram stain, intraamniotic glucose level determination, leukocyte esterase assay, and the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay were performed on 144 amniotic fluid specimens retrieved by transabdominal amniocentesis in 136 patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes or preterm labor.
METHODS    				Diagnostic indices for a positive amniotic fluid culture and the development of clinical infection were calculated for each rapid test.
METHODS    				Receiver-operator characteristic curves were generated to help select the optimal glucose level and combination of tests to detect intraamniotic infection.
RESULTS    				The greatest sensitivity for predicting either a positive culture or subsequent clinical infection in preterm labor patients and in predicting clinical infection in patients with preterm premature rupture of the membranes was demonstrated by a low glucose level.
RESULTS    				The Gram stain provided the greatest positive predictive value in patients with preterm labor.
RESULTS    				Combining the Gram stain and measurement of intraamniotic glucose levels did not improve sensitivity above glucose alone or positive predictive value above Gram stain alone.
CONCLUSIONS				Leukocyte esterase determination and Limulus amebocyte lysate assay are insensitive indicators of intraamniotic infection.
CONCLUSIONS				Selection of Gram stain or glucose level measurement alone or in combination as an appropriate screen for intraamniotic infection will depend on the clinicians' false-positive rate threshold.

#### Prognostic implications of asymptomatic ventricular arrhythmias: the Framingham Heart Study.

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the prevalence and prognostic significance of asymptomatic complex or frequent ventricular premature beats detected during ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring.
METHODS    				Cohort study with a follow-up period of 4 to 6 years.
METHODS    				Population-based.
METHODS    				Surviving patients of the original Framingham Heart Study cohort and offspring of original cohort members (2727 men and 3306 women).
METHODS    				One-hour ambulatory electrocardiography.
RESULTS    				The age-adjusted prevalence of complex or frequent arrhythmia (more than 30 ventricular premature complexes per hour or multiform premature complexes, ventricular couplets, ventricular tachycardia, or R-on-T ventricular premature complexes) was 12% (95% Cl, 11% to 13%) in the 2425 men without clinically evident coronary heart disease and 33% (Cl, 24% to 42%) in the 302 men with coronary heart disease.
RESULTS    				The corresponding values in women (3064 without disease and 242 with disease) were 12% (Cl, 11% to 13%) and 26% (Cl, 9% to 43%).
RESULTS    				After adjusting for age and traditional risk factors for coronary heart disease in a Cox proportional hazards model, men without coronary heart disease who had complex or frequent ventricular arrhythmias were at increased risk for both all-cause mortality (relative risk, 2.30; Cl, 1.65 to 3.20) and the occurrence of myocardial infarction or death from coronary heart disease (relative risk, 2.12; Cl, 1.33 to 3.38).
RESULTS    				In men with coronary heart disease and in women with and without coronary heart disease, complex or frequent arrhythmias were not associated with an increased risk for either outcome.
CONCLUSIONS				In men who do not have clinically apparent coronary heart disease, the incidental detection of ventricular arrhythmias is associated with a twofold increase in the risk for all-cause mortality and myocardial infarction or death due to coronary heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS				The preventive and therapeutic implications of these findings await further investigation.

#### Hepatitis C virus seroprevalence in the developmentally disabled.

BACKGROUND 				Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the principal cause of nonenteric non-A, non-B hepatitis worldwide.
BACKGROUND 				While it has been well documented that people with developmental disabilities are at an increased risk for infections with hepatitis B virus, little is known of the prevalence of HCV infection among this population.
METHODS    				Serum samples obtained from 113 evaluable outpatients with developmental disabilities at one center in suburban New York City (NY) were tested for antibodies to HCV and hepatitis B core antibody.
RESULTS    				None of the 113 samples tested positive for HCV antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas 24 (21%) showed serologic evidence of past hepatitis B virus infection on the basis of hepatitis B core antibody positivity.
RESULTS    				Three (2.7%) were also positive for hepatitis B surface antigen.
CONCLUSIONS				In contrast to hepatitis B virus, HCV infection is uncommon among outpatients with developmental disabilities in suburban New York City.
CONCLUSIONS				Further testing for HCV is indicated to determine if these results can be generalized to individuals within institutions, or to individuals in other geographic locations.

#### Purkinje fibre-papillary muscle interaction in the genesis of triggered activity in a guinea pig model.

OBJECTIVE  				Previous studies have attempted to characterise the genesis of triggered activity related to early afterdepolarisations.
OBJECTIVE  				Little is known about their conduction behaviour.
OBJECTIVE  				This study was designed to examine the origin and conduction behaviour of triggered activations to throw light on the pathogenesis of torsade de pointes.
METHODS    				Electrophysiological interactions related to triggered activations and early afterdepolarisations between papillary muscle and Purkinje fibres were studied in the guinea pig in a single chambered bath.
METHODS    				EDTA (5 mM) in Tyrode's solution was used and microelectrodes were placed in both papillary muscle and Purkinje fibres.
RESULTS    				During early superfusion, marked prolongation of action potential duration and early afterdepolarisations occurred in Purkinje fibres but not in papillary muscle.
RESULTS    				In addition: (1) with prolongation of action potential duration and early afterdepolarisations in Purkinje fibres, triggered activations arose during phase 2 and were conducted to papillary muscle, where they induced activations; (2) the number of papillary muscle discharges increased with the increase in Purkinje fibre action potential duration in a linear correlation; (3) severing a segment of papillary muscle from Purkinje fibres eliminated these papillary muscle activations; (4) some triggered activations did not conduct to papillary muscle; these had smaller amplitude, slower rate of depolarisation (dV/dt), more positive activation voltage, and similar peak voltages compared to conducted triggered activations; (5) a low plateau resulting from electrotonic interaction was recorded at the Purkinje fibre-papillary muscle junction; this plateau may have facilitated conduction of triggered activations.
CONCLUSIONS				In this preparation there was a disparity of effect on Purkinje fibre and papillary muscle.
CONCLUSIONS				Prolongation of action potential duration and repetitive activations due to early afterdepolarisations originated in Purkinje fibres and were conducted to papillary muscle.
CONCLUSIONS				Purkinje fibre-papillary muscle interactions are of interest in relation to torsade de pointes arrhythmias which are believed to arise from this mechanism.

#### [Polymorphism MI detected through the enzyme MspI in the study of congenital protein C deficiency].

BACKGROUND 				In order to find alternatives for the diagnosis of hereditary protein C (PC) deficiency, we have studied the diagnostic informativity of the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) MI, located 7 kb upstream of the PC gene and detected with the restriction enzyme MspI.
METHODS    				The RFLP MI has been analysed in 77 individuals belonging to 27 families with congenital PC deficiency, as well as in a control group of 46 healthy donors.
METHODS    				The analysis has been performed by PCR amplification and MspI digestion of the polymorphic DNA fragment.
RESULTS    				The allelic frequencies of the RFLP MI in the population studied are 0.69 for the allele A1, without the MspI restriction site, and 0.31 for the allele A2, with the MspI site.
RESULTS    				No differences have been found between the control and the PC deficient groups.
RESULTS    				The informativity of the polymorphism has been calculated to be 33.8%.
RESULTS    				Consegregation studies between this RFLP and PC deficiency have allowed the determination of the allele associated to the polymorphism in 21 out of the 27 studied families.
RESULTS    				Furthermore, an asymptomatic PC deficient carrier, with normal PC levels, has been identified.
CONCLUSIONS				The study of this RFLP in families with hereditary PC deficiency may be useful for the identification of PC deficient carriers as well as for the prenatal diagnosis of the deficiency.

#### Abnormal labor and infant brain damage.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine whether arrest disorders result in increased neurologic abnormalities in infancy or childhood.
METHODS    				Four hundred thirteen infants with arrest disorders as defined by Friedman criteria were matched to a similar population without arrest disorders.
METHODS    				The median length of follow-up was 6 years for the study infants and 5.07 years for the controls.
METHODS    				The numbers of children with abnormalities in the groups with and without arrest disorders, as well as the specific abnormalities encountered, were stratified by method of delivery.
RESULTS    				Thirty neurologic abnormalities were found in the arrest group and 37 in the control group; thus, the null hypotheses could not be rejected.
RESULTS    				In addition, although the control group was not followed as long as the study population, the diagnosis of abnormalities was more frequent in the later years in the controls.
RESULTS    				This suggests that had the follow-ups been equal, there would have been stronger proof that arrest by itself was not associated with infant brain damage.
CONCLUSIONS				Our study confirms that labor diagnoses of prolonged active phase, protractions or arrests, and failure to descend are not associated with increased neurologic abnormalities.
CONCLUSIONS				Delivery by cesarean or vaginal birth and use of oxytocin are not factors in the etiology of major brain damage.

#### Amniocentesis--still important in the management of severe rhesus incompatibility.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the role of amniocentesis in the management of severe rhesus (Rh), incompatibility.
METHODS    				A 10-year retrospective descriptive study.
METHODS    				Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Tygerberg Hospital, CP.
METHODS    				111 pregnancies complicated by severe Rh incompatibility where management had been based on results obtained from amniocentesis.
METHODS    				Neonatal haemoglobin values, neonatal survival and short-term morbidity as compared with the position on the Liley chart after amniocentesis immediately before delivery.
RESULTS    				Average neonatal haemoglobin value decreased for the group in the lower zone through the midzone to the upper zone, but wide scattering of individual values between the various zones occurred.
RESULTS    				Perinatal mortality rate was 93/1,000 deliveries with Rh-related deaths occurring only in the upper midzone and upper zones.
RESULTS    				One death and 7 cases of morbidity occurred after acting on misleading information from the Liley curve.
CONCLUSIONS				Amniotic fluid bilirubin values are at best an indirect evaluation of the state of disease.
CONCLUSIONS				No serious complications are likely to occur when these values fall in the lower or lower mid-zones of the Liley chart.
CONCLUSIONS				When bilirubin values fall in the upper midzone or upper zone, cordocentesis should be performed to prevent overreaction or to perform an intra-uterine transfusion.

#### Hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 reduces infarct volume after embolic stroke in rats.

OBJECTIVE  				We evaluated isovolumic hemodilution with hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.
OBJECTIVE  				This compound avoids the unfavorable viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation abnormalities of low molecular weight dextran during administration over a period of several days.
METHODS    				Sprague-Dawley rats, anesthetized with 0.5-1% halothane and 70% N2O, were subjected to silicon cylinder (treated and control groups) or sham (sham group) embolization of the cerebral circulation.
METHODS    				Thirty minutes after embolization, the treated group (n = 5) was infused with 11 ml/kg of 10% hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5, and the control (n = 5) and sham (n = 4) groups were infused with saline for 1 hour.
METHODS    				In the treated group, 7.1 ml/kg of blood was withdrawn.
METHODS    				After 24 hours, the animals were reanesthetized, and cerebral blood flow was determined with [14C]iodoantipyrine.
METHODS    				Alternative brain slices were either incubated with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for infarct volume determination or frozen for ischemic volume and cerebral blood flow determination using autoradiography.
RESULTS    				The hematocrit in the treated group was reduced from (mean +/- SEM) 46 +/- 1% to 35 +/- 2% at 1.5 hours (p < 0.01).
RESULTS    				Cortical blood flow was within the normal range of 115-185 ml/min/100 g, except for the ischemic cortex in the embolized groups, treated and control.
RESULTS    				The ischemic and infarct volume of the treated group was reduced by 74% (p < 0.05) and 89% (p < 0.05), respectively, from the control group.
RESULTS    				The treated and sham ischemic and infarct volumes were not statistically different.
CONCLUSIONS				These data suggest that hydroxyethyl starch 200/0.5 could be an effective treatment for ischemic stroke when administered early, because it reduces infarct and ischemic volumes from control values to levels indistinguishable from those of the sham group.

#### Failure of anticytokeratin 18 antibody to improve flow cytometric detection of bladder cancer.

BACKGROUND 				Bladder washing specimens containing inflammatory or squamous cells have been difficult to accurately analyze with single-parameter DNA flow cytometric (FCM) methods.
METHODS    				The anticytokeratin 18 antibody, CK5, was used in a multiparameter assay of 275 bladder washing and voided urine specimens to immunoselect only the bladder transitional cells for DNA analysis.
RESULTS    				Flow cytometric detection of transitional cell carcinoma was increased by immunoselection of CK5-positive cells in specimens from patients with disease.
RESULTS    				Unfortunately, a similar increase in hyperdiploid cells in pathologically benign specimens was observed, which resulted in a false-positive rate of 45%.
RESULTS    				In some instances, multiparameter FCM assays with CK5 could detect aneuploid cell populations not clearly evident by single-parameter analysis.
CONCLUSIONS				However, the results from this study of the hyperdiploid cell fraction showed that the increased sensitivity resulting from the use of CK5 was not clinically useful because of the decrease in specificity.



### 1280532
#### Changes in ventricular 1,2-diacylglycerol content in rats following monocrotaline treatment.

OBJECTIVE  				1,2-Diacylglycerol may initiate cardiac hypertrophy, probably by activating protein kinase C. To test this hypothesis we determined the 1,2-diacylglycerol content of hypertrophied tissue.
METHODS    				Rats were treated with monocrotaline and developed severe right ventricular hypertrophy followed by congestive heart failure.
METHODS    				1,2-Diacylglycerol content and fatty acid composition, DNA concentrations, and RNA concentrations in the right ventricle from monocrotaline treated rats were compared with values obtained from the left side or from control rats.
RESULTS    				During the first week, the right ventricle showed no significant change in 1,2-diacylglycerol content and a small increase in RNA concentration.
RESULTS    				However, the 1,2-diacylglycerol content was significantly increased by 55% at two weeks after monocrotaline injection, when DNA and RNA synthesis was also enhanced to its highest level when compared with control rats (37% and 18%, respectively).
RESULTS    				At four weeks after monocrotaline injection, conversely, the 1,2-diacylglycerol content was decreased by 25% in the right ventricle from monocrotaline treated rats, most of which had pleural and peritoneal effusions indicating congestive heart failure, although RNA synthesis was sustained at a high level.
RESULTS    				The fatty acid composition of 1,2-diacylglycerol did not differ significantly between the right and left ventricles or control rat ventricles.
CONCLUSIONS				These results suggest that 1,2-diacylglycerol accumulation is associated with development of hypertrophy in monocrotaline treated rats.
CONCLUSIONS				In contrast, at a stage of congestive heart failure 1,2-diacylglycerol production decreased, suggesting that intracellular transduction mechanisms may be attenuated.

#### CD43 expression in B cell lymphoma.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the expression of CD43 in frozen sections in a range of B cell lymphomas.
METHODS    				The monoclonal antibody WR14, clustered provisionally in the Fourth Leucocyte Typing Workshop as a CD43 reagent, was investigated by epitope blocking studies on formalin fixed reactive lymph node tissue, using the established CD43 antibody MT1, to validate its use as a CD43 reagent.
METHODS    				CD43 expression was studied in 131 immunophenotypically defined B cell lymphomas, including lymphocytic lymphoma (Lc, n = 13), centrocytic lymphoma (Cc, n = 14), and a range of follicle centre cell lymphomas (FCC) including centroblastic/centrocytic follicular (CbCcF, n = 48), centroblastic diffuse (CbD, n = 39), centroblastic/centrocytic diffuse (CbCcD, n = 4), centroblastic follicular and diffuse (Cb FD, n = 3) and centroblastic/centrocytic follicular and diffuse (CbCc FD, n = 1).
METHODS    				Nine lymphomas of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) were also examined.
RESULTS    				Epitope blocking studies showed that WR14 is a CD43 reagent that binds to an epitope identical with or close to that recognised by MT1.
RESULTS    				Eleven of 13 (84%) cases of Lc and 11 of 14 (78%) cases of Cc expressed CD43; 87 of 95 (91%) cases of FCC did not.
RESULTS    				All eight low grade lymphomas of MALT were negative.
RESULTS    				One high grade lymphoma, transformed from a low grade MALT lymphoma, was positive for CD43.
RESULTS    				The expression of CD43 by tumours of B cell lineage was associated with the expression of CD5 (p < 0.001) although either antigen could occasionally be found in the absence of the other.
CONCLUSIONS				CD43 reagents can be used in conjunction with CD5 antibodies for the immunophenotypic discrimination of follicle centre cell lymphomas from non-follicle centre cell lymphomas.

#### Canine left ventricular hypertrophy predisposes to ventricular tachycardia induction by phase 2 early afterdepolarizations after administration of BAY K 8644.

OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the longer duration of ventricular action potentials in hypertrophied hearts predisposes to the development of early after-depolarizations and triggered ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
BACKGROUND 				For unknown reasons, the incidence of sudden death is greater in patients with myocardial hypertrophy.
METHODS    				We measured left ventricular monophasic action potentials in normal dogs and dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy before and after administration of the calcium agonist BAY K 8644 and the potassium channel blocker cesium.
RESULTS    				We demonstrated longer action potential durations in dogs with than in those without left ventricular hypertrophy.
RESULTS    				Also, BAY K 8644 produced phase 2 early afterdepolarizations and ventricular tachyarrhythmias more frequently in the dogs with than in those without left ventricular hypertrophy.
RESULTS    				Phenylephrine, an alpha agonist, further increased the action potential duration in hypertrophied hearts and the propensity to develop early afterdepolarizations and ventricular tachyarrhythmia after administration of BAY K 8644.
RESULTS    				Control and hypertrophied hearts developed early afterdepolarizations and ventricular tachyarrhythmia equally when exposed to cesium.
CONCLUSIONS				Although in vitro studies have shown that fibers of hypertrophied ventricular myocardium can develop triggered activity as a result of both early and late afterdepolarizations, the present study is the first to show in vivo that the hypertrophied ventricular myocardium compared with the normal ventricle is predisposed to develop phase 2 early afterdepolarizations that appear to trigger ventricular tachyarrhythmia.
CONCLUSIONS				It is possible that such a mechanism contributes to the development of ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.
CONCLUSIONS				If this is shown to be true, specific pharmacologic interventions can be suggested.



### 1280673
#### A promising interferon plus four-drug chemotherapy regimen for metastatic melanoma.

OBJECTIVE  				The goal of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of a four-drug chemotherapy regimen combined with natural leukocyte interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) for metastatic melanoma.
METHODS    				Between December 1988 and December 1991, 48 consecutive unselected patients with metastatic melanoma were entered onto this phase II study.
METHODS    				Forty-five of these patients were assessable for response and 46 for toxicity.
METHODS    				The four-drug chemotherapy regimen was as follows: dacarbazine (DTIC) 200 mg/m2 days 1 to 5, vincristine 1 mg/m2 days 1 and 4, bleomycin 15 mg days 2 and 5 intravenously (IV), and lomustine (CCNU) 80 mg day 1 orally.
METHODS    				IFN-alpha, initiated day 8, was administered 3 x 10(6) IU/d, subcutaneously (SC) for 6 weeks, followed by 6 x 10(6) IU three times per week.
METHODS    				A small protocol modification was adopted from the 21st patient onwards whenever there was more than 2 months' stabilization or progression with the original protocol: IFN therapy was split into 2-week treatment periods interrupted by a 2-week rest period.
RESULTS    				Among the 45 assessable patients, the objective response rate was 62% (95% confidence limit, 48 to 77); six patients (13%) achieved a complete response (CR) and 22 (49%) a partial response (PR).
RESULTS    				Metastases in such sites as liver also responded favorably (one CR, six PR, one stable disease [SD], two progressive disease [PD]).
RESULTS    				After splitting IFN therapy for nonresponders, in two patients PD and in another two patients SD changed into regression.
RESULTS    				Three of the six patients with a CR have suffered a relapse, but the other three have been off treatment for 7, 18, and 31 months without recurrence.
RESULTS    				Most of the symptomatic patients also experienced rapid relief of symptoms.
RESULTS    				Overall toxicity of this mainly outpatient regimen seemed to be acceptable.
RESULTS    				One patient died of a septic fever with grade 4 leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.
RESULTS    				The most frequent side effects were transient fever, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, and grade I/II hematologic toxicity.
CONCLUSIONS				Results demonstrate a remarkably high response rate in combining IFN-alpha and four chemotherapeutic agents.
CONCLUSIONS				The apparent schedule-dependency of responses must be further explored in a controlled phase III study.

#### Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor infusion makes high-dose etoposide a safe outpatient regimen that is effective in lymphoma and myeloma patients.

OBJECTIVE  				This study assessed the efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) or recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in ameliorating the extent and duration of hematologic toxicity after high-dose etoposide cancer therapy.
METHODS    				Thirty-two non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloma patients were treated with 2 to 2.4 g/m2 etoposide infused intravenously (IV) during a 10- to 12-hour period, followed 72 hours later by subcutaneous administration of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF.
METHODS    				Hematologic toxicity was compared with that observed in 29 patients who were treated with high-dose etoposide without growth factors.
RESULTS    				The median duration of grade 4 neutropenia in growth factor-treated patients was 3 days, and granulocyte counts never decreased to less than 100/microL in approximately half of the patients.
RESULTS    				The corresponding figures in the control patients were 8 and 3 days, respectively (P < .0001).
RESULTS    				No effect was observed in platelet and RBC recovery.
RESULTS    				Growth factor-treated patients became eligible to receive additional myelotoxic chemotherapy a median of 5 days earlier than controls.
RESULTS    				Nonhematologic toxicity was minimal.
RESULTS    				Grade 1 mucositis was observed in two of 61 patients (3%).
RESULTS    				Antitumor activity assessed within 1 month after etoposide administration was documented in 58% of 38 assessable patients.
RESULTS    				Finally, high-dose etoposide expanded and mobilized the pool of peripheral-blood hematopoietic progenitors.
CONCLUSIONS				The use of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF makes high-dose etoposide a safe outpatient regimen and should encourage the inclusion of this highly effective and well-tolerated drug in novel treatment strategies that use high-dose therapy early in the clinical course of chemosensitive tumors.

#### The natural history of community-acquired hepatitis C in the United States. The Sentinel Counties Chronic non-A, non-B Hepatitis Study Team.

BACKGROUND 				Chronic liver disease develops in more than half of patients with post-transfusion hepatitis C, but little is known about the natural history of community-acquired hepatitis C.
METHODS    				In 1985 and 1986 we identified adults with acute non-A, non-B hepatitis in four counties in the United States and followed them prospectively.
METHODS    				We used three markers to detect hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in stored samples of serum: antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) detected by second-generation serologic assays; HCV RNA detected by polymerase-chain-reaction assay; and antibody to HCV antigen (anti-HCVAg) detected by fluorescent-antibody-blocking assay.
RESULTS    				Of 130 patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis, 106 (82 percent) had HCV infection, 93 were positive for anti-HCV, and 13 were positive only for HCV RNA or anti-HCVAg.
RESULTS    				Chronic hepatitis developed in 60 (62 percent) of 97 HCV-infected patients followed for 9 to 48 months, with no relation to the risk factors for infection.
RESULTS    				Ten of the 30 patients who had liver biopsies had chronic active hepatitis.
RESULTS    				In samples collected 42 to 48 months after the onset of hepatitis, HCV RNA was detected in 12 of 13 tested patients with chronic hepatitis and in all 15 tested patients with hepatitis that had resolved.
RESULTS    				Anti-HCV persisted in all but two of the initially positive patients, for a rate of antibody loss of 0.6 per 100 person-years.
CONCLUSIONS				Patients with community-acquired hepatitis C have a high rate of chronic hepatitis.
CONCLUSIONS				HCV may be a major cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, and in most patients HCV infection seems to persist for at least several years, even in the absence of active liver disease.

#### Multifocal choroiditis and choroidal neovascularization associated with the multiple evanescent white dot and acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement syndrome.

BACKGROUND 				Several recent articles have described syndromes in which there is enlargement of the blind spot associated with retinal lesions.
BACKGROUND 				These have included the multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, acute macular neuroretinopathy, acute idiopathic blind spot enlargement syndrome, and multifocal choroiditis or pseudo presumed ocular histoplasmosis syndrome (pseudo POHS).
METHODS    				The authors reviewed the records of seven patients in whom signs and symptoms of acute enlargement of the blind spot and pseudo POHS developed.
RESULTS    				All seven patients had photopsia accompanying enlargement of the blind spot during their illness.
RESULTS    				Four had transient white spots as seen in the multiple evanescent white dot syndrome.
RESULTS    				All presented with or developed chorioretinal scars or neovascularization similar to that seen in multifocal choroiditis or pseudo POHS.
RESULTS    				In four of the seven patients, POHS-like scars developed only in the eye that was symptomatic with blind spot enlargement and photopsia.
RESULTS    				Five of the 7 had visual acuity of 20/25 or better at the last follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS				It would appear that there is an overlap in the clinical findings of all of these syndromes and that there may be a common link in their etiology.

#### Multiglandular disease in seemingly sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism revisited: where are we in the early 1990s? A plea against unilateral parathyroid exploration.

BACKGROUND 				Most of the available data on multiglandular disease (MGD) originate from long-term series.
BACKGROUND 				The spectrum of the disease has changed now because of earlier diagnosis.
BACKGROUND 				We decided to assess the current frequency of MGD in seemingly sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism.
METHODS    				MGD was defined as the finding that more than one grossly enlarged gland weighed more than 50 mg and the rim of normal parathyroid tissue was diagnostic of adenoma.
METHODS    				Nine hundred eight consecutive neck explorations for hyperparathyroidism were performed, 624 before 1989 and 284 between 1989 and 1991, and studied retrospectively.
METHODS    				Since 1989, oil Red O staining has been done to assess hyperfunction.
RESULTS    				When multiple endocrine neoplasia and non-multiple endocrine neoplasia familial cases of hyperparathyroidism are excluded, the frequency of MGD in seemingly sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism, 17.7% before 1989, is still 14% since then, including a 3% frequency of true multiple adenomas.
RESULTS    				With more restrictive criteria, which exclude the second enlarged gland if it weighed less than 100 mg, if it had no rim, and if oil Red O staining was negative, the frequency of MGD in sporadic hyperparathyroidism has remained 11% since 1989.
RESULTS    				Unilateral exploration had missed 78% of second enlarged glands, and preoperative imaging studies, when performed, showed more than one gland in only two of 22 cases.
CONCLUSIONS				Routine bilateral neck exploration is recommended in primary hyperparathyroidism because of a current frequency of MGD of at least 11%.

#### Sperm nuclear chromatin normality: relationship with sperm morphology, sperm-zona pellucida binding, and fertilization rates in vitro.

OBJECTIVE  				To study whether the results of tests of sperm chromatin and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) normality are related to fertilization rates in vitro.
METHODS    				Normal morphology, nuclear maturity determined by acidic aniline blue stain, and DNA normality determined by acridine orange fluorescence of sperm in insemination medium and the number of sperm bound to the zona pellucida (ZP) of the oocytes that had failed to fertilize in vitro were determined.
METHODS    				The relationship between sperm test results and fertilization rates were analyzed by logistic regression.
METHODS    				Samples were obtained from patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.
RESULTS    				The number of sperm bound to the ZP, the percentage of sperm with normal morphology, and the percentage of sperm with normal DNA were the most significant factors related to fertilization rates in vitro.
RESULTS    				In patients with normal morphology > or = 15% or with > 10 sperm bound per ZP, the percentage of sperm with normal DNA, the number of sperm bound to the ZP, and motility grade were significantly related to IVF rates.
CONCLUSIONS				In patients with normal morphology > or = 15%, failure of fertilization may be because of defects of sperm-ZP binding or abnormal DNA.
CONCLUSIONS				Assessment of DNA normality of motile sperm in the insemination medium may aid prediction of fertilization rates in addition to normal morphology and sperm-ZP binding.

#### Tumor angiogenesis: a new significant and independent prognostic indicator in early-stage breast carcinoma.

BACKGROUND 				Axillary lymph node status has been the most important prognostic factor in operable breast carcinoma, but it does not fully account for the varied disease outcome.
BACKGROUND 				More accurate prognostic indicators would help in selection of patients at high risk for disease recurrence and death who are candidates for systemic adjuvant therapy.
BACKGROUND 				Our recent findings indicated that microvessel density (count or grade) in invasive breast carcinoma (a measure of tumor angiogenesis) is associated with metastasis and thus may be a prognostic indicator.
OBJECTIVE  				This study was designed to further define the relationship of microvessel density with overall and relapse-free survival and with other reported prognostic indicators in breast carcinoma.
METHODS    				In a prospective, blinded study of 165 consecutive patients, the microvessels within primary invasive breast carcinoma were highlighted by immunocytochemical staining to detect factor VIII-related antigen.
METHODS    				Using light microscopy, we counted microvessels per 200x field in the most active areas of neovascularization and graded microvessel density.
METHODS    				These findings were correlated, by univariate and multivariate analyses, with overall and relapse-free survival, axillary node status, and other prognostic indicators (median follow-up, 51 months).
RESULTS    				There was a highly significant (P < or = .001) association of microvessel density with overall survival and relapse-free survival in all patients, including node-negative and node-positive subsets.
RESULTS    				All patients with breast carcinomas having more than 100 microvessels per 200x field experienced tumor recurrence within 33 months of diagnosis, compared with less than 5% of the patients with breast carcinoma having 33 or fewer microvessels per 200x field.
RESULTS    				Moreover, microvessel density was the only statistically significant predictor of overall survival among node-negative women (P < .001).
RESULTS    				Only microvessel density (P < .001) and histologic grade (P = .04) showed statistically significant correlations with relapse-free survival in the node-negative subset.
CONCLUSIONS				Microvessel density in the area of the most intense neovascularization in invasive breast carcinoma is an independent and highly significant prognostic indicator for overall and relapse-free survival in patients with early-stage breast carcinoma (I or II by International Union Against Cancer criteria).
CONCLUSIONS				Such an indicator would be useful in selection of those node-negative patients with breast carcinoma who are at high risk for having occult metastasis at presentation.
CONCLUSIONS				These patients could then be given systemic adjuvant therapy.

#### The health of children adopted from Romania.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the medical condition of Romanian adoptees and the effects of the Romanian orphanage system on their health.
METHODS    				Case series.
METHODS    				The international adoption clinics at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and the New England Medical Center, Tufts University, Boston, Mass.
METHODS    				Sixty-five Romanian adoptees who were brought to the United States during a 12-month period beginning in October 1990.
METHODS    				Incidence of hepatitis B, intestinal parasites, tuberculosis, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, growth failure, and developmental delay.
RESULTS    				Although the adopted children were presumably chosen from the most vital and attractive adoptees, only 15% were judged to be physically healthy and developmentally normal.
RESULTS    				Fifty-three percent had serological evidence of past or present hepatitis B infection, and 20% of screened children tested positive for hepatitis B surface antigen.
RESULTS    				In children aged 7 months or older, the overall prevalence of chronic hepatitis B was 23%.
RESULTS    				Intestinal parasites were found in 33% of subjects, and 45% of infected children had two or more pathogens identified.
RESULTS    				All the children tested for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 were negative.
RESULTS    				Two patterns of growth failure were observed that resembled the two subtypes of psychosocial short stature that occur in association with prolonged psychological harassment or emotional deprivation.
RESULTS    				Infants' length, weight, head circumference, and weight-for-height were adversely affected by institutionalization.
RESULTS    				Older children's height was reduced.
RESULTS    				Only 10% of children older than 12 months were developmentally normal.
CONCLUSIONS				Romanian adoptees are an extraordinarily high-risk pediatric group as a consequences of decades of government-sanctioned child neglect and abuse.

#### Angiogenesis can be stimulated or repressed in vivo by a change in GM3:GD3 ganglioside ratio.

BACKGROUND 				We had previously observed that rabbit cornea stimulated by an angiogenic factor 1) became richer in total gangliosides and 2) reduced the GM3:GD3 ganglioside ratio.
BACKGROUND 				Moreover, experimentally induced global enrichment of corneal gangliosides favors angiogenesis.
METHODS    				The objective of this work was to explain the possible relationship between angiogenic response and changes in the GM3:GD3 ratios observed in vivo.
METHODS    				Cornea was utilized because it is avascular and transparent; i.e., the onset of opacity permitted exclusion of angiogenesis produced by a generic inflammatory response.
METHODS    				Prostaglandin E1 or basic fibroblast growth factor were applied as angiogenesis triggers.
METHODS    				Angiogenesis in vivo and mobilization and growth of microvascular endothelium in vitro were taken as parameters to indicate whether differences in GM3:GD3 ratios could modify the extent of the angiogenic response.
RESULTS    				In vivo angiogenesis, whether prostaglandin E1 or basic fibroblast growth factor induced, was repressed by GM3 and enhanced by GD3 or GM1 enrichment of the cornea.
RESULTS    				In vitro growth and motility of microvascular endothelium were reduced by GM3 addition to the medium and returned to normal levels by addition of GD3.
CONCLUSIONS				Formation of new vessels induced by two different angiogenic factors could be stimulated or repressed in the cornea by reduction or enhancement of the GM3:GD3 ratio of tissue gangliosides.
CONCLUSIONS				Changes in the relative proportion of molecules normally present in adult tissues, like prostaglandin E1, basic fibroblast growth factor, GM3, GD3, were sufficient to modulate or even block angiogenesis.

#### Distribution and cellular origin of undulin in rat liver.

BACKGROUND 				Undulin is a novel large glycoprotein of the interstitial extracellular matrix belonging to the fibronectin-tenascin glycoprotein gene family.
BACKGROUND 				The distribution in diseased liver and the cellular origin of this protein are unknown.
METHODS    				Immunohistochemistry studies were performed on cryostat sections of normal and damaged rat livers (CCl4 model).
METHODS    				Hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, fat-storing cells (FSC), and sinusoidal endothelial cells (EC) were isolated by standard methods and kept in culture.
METHODS    				Undulin biosynthesis in vitro was studied by indirect immunofluorescence and by immunoprecipitation of endogenously labeled protein followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.
RESULTS    				Undulin was demonstrated in portal stroma, in vascular adventitia, and inside the space of Disse of normal liver.
RESULTS    				Acutely and chronically damaged livers revealed strong staining reactions in damaged areas, scars, and sinusoids.
RESULTS    				The overall distribution of undulin resembled the pattern noted for fibronectin.
RESULTS    				In contrast to undulin, tenascin was not detectable within the adventitia of vascular and ductular structures of normal and damaged livers, and tenascin accumulated preferentially at scar-parenchyma interfaces in fibrotic livers.
RESULTS    				In vivo, desmin and smooth muscle alpha-actin positive cells were in part codistributed with undulin fibers as shown by double staining techniques.
RESULTS    				In vitro, undulin was detected in granules of freshly isolated FSCs and ECs and was localized as fibers in the extracellular matrix of cultivated FSCs and ECs.
RESULTS    				Synthesis of undulin was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the protein from cultured FSCs and ECs.
RESULTS    				No experimental evidence was found for undulin synthesis in vitro by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells.
CONCLUSIONS				The novel glycoprotein undulin is present in the normal rat liver and accumulates during acute and chronic liver injury.
CONCLUSIONS				Our results suggest that among the resident cells of the liver, FSCs and ECs are the major sources of undulin.

#### [Palliative care in cancer patients. Frequency and priority of symptoms].

BACKGROUND 				The presence of multiple symptoms is very frequent in patients with advanced cancer disease.
BACKGROUND 				In this situation in which cure is not a realistic aim, the goal is to achieve symptom control and to give support to the patient and family.
BACKGROUND 				This study was designed to identify the most common and priority symptoms in patients with advanced cancer.
METHODS    				Patients were given a questionnaire with a list of symptoms and were asked to underline those they presented, and also number those they considered most distressful from 1-3.
METHODS    				Physicians and nurse independently answered the same questionnaire.
RESULTS    				Asthenia was the most frequent symptom (patient evaluation 84%, nurse 82% and doctor 93%).
RESULTS    				Psychopathological disturbances showed a high prevalence.
RESULTS    				Regarding patient evaluation, dry mouth was the third symptom in frequency (73%), but it was detected by nurses in 39% and by physicians in 16%.
RESULTS    				Priority symptoms for the three groups were pain, asthenia, anorexia and anxiety.
RESULTS    				Pain was controlled in 19/22 patients (86%), while psychopathological symptoms were only controlled in 7/19 patients (27%).
CONCLUSIONS				In order to optimize treatment patient participation is mandatory.
CONCLUSIONS				An interdisciplinary team (physicians, nurses, social workers, and psychologists) is necessary to take care of these patients.

#### [Retarded motor and cognitive development of young children with severe kidney disorders].

OBJECTIVE  				Medical and technical advances make it possible to treat young children with end-stage renal disease with far-reaching methods such as continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and haemodialysis (HD).
OBJECTIVE  				We investigated whether chronic renal failure has deleterious effects on motor function and cognitive development.
METHODS    				The pediatric dialysis centres of the university hospitals of Nijmegen, Utrecht and Rotterdam.
METHODS    				Prospective study.
METHODS    				18 patients (mean age 37 months) with chronic renal failure since infancy and 18 healthy children (mean age 35 months) as controls were assessed on cognitive and behavioural parameters.
METHODS    				Nine patients and 17 control subjects were tested on their motor function.
RESULTS    				A significant delay (more than one SD) was found in the motor as well as in the cognitive development of the patient group.
RESULTS    				Within this group a large difference was noticed between patients under conservative treatment (n = 8; mean dev.
RESULTS    				index 92.0) and those under CAPD or HD treatment (n = 10; mean dev.
RESULTS    				index 72.4).
CONCLUSIONS				Young dialysis patients are evidently at risk for developmental retardation.
CONCLUSIONS				Monitoring this vulnerable group by developmental screening and intensive counselling of the parents is strongly recommended.

#### Direct in vitro infection of human intestine with HIV-1.

OBJECTIVE  				To directly infect human fetal intestine with HIV in vitro.
METHODS    				Human fetal intestinal explant cultures were exposed to HIV-1 and monitored for evidence of infection by biochemical assay, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.
METHODS    				Human fetal intestinal explants (14-21 weeks) were established in culture and exposed to HIV-1.
METHODS    				Tissue culture fluid was assayed for p24 antigen and reverse transcriptase activity over a 14-day period.
METHODS    				Explants were removed from culture on days 4, 7, 10 and 14 postinoculation and subjected (1) to immunohistochemistry to detect p24 and gp160/41 antigens, and (2) to in situ hybridization to detect HIV-1 RNA.
METHODS    				Explant tissue culture fluid was cocultured with Jurkat T-cells to detect infectious viral particles.
RESULTS    				Reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen levels in fetal explant culture fluid rose between 7 and 14 days after viral inoculation.
RESULTS    				Jurkat T-cell cocultures confirmed the presence of infectious virus.
RESULTS    				Cells in the lamina propria resembling lymphocytes and macrophages of both small intestine and colon stained positively for the viral proteins p24 and gp41.
RESULTS    				The same type of cells also stained positively for HIV-1 RNA using in situ hybridization.
RESULTS    				Dual-label immunohistochemistry, combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization confirmed the presence of viral protein and RNA in cells bearing the CD3, CD4 (lymphocyte) or CD68 (macrophage) surface markers.
RESULTS    				There was no evidence at any time of HIV-1 infection of epithelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS				Cells of the lamina propria of the small intestine and colon, bearing lymphocyte or macrophage markers, can be directly infected by and support the replication of HIV-1.
CONCLUSIONS				Such infection may be implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV enteropathy.

#### Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV infection treated with vincristine and bleomycin.

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of vincristine and bleomycin when used in combination to treat patients with progressive Kaposi's sarcoma.
METHODS    				A retrospective case notes review.
METHODS    				The departments of Immunology and Genito-Urinary Medicine, St Mary's Hospital, London, UK.
METHODS    				All patients presenting with progressive Kaposi's sarcoma and requiring chemotherapy between January 1987 and January 1990, who had received no previous systemic chemotherapy.
METHODS    				Treatment with vincristine (2 mg) and bleomycin (30 mg, 18 h infusion), or vinblastine (2.5-5.0 mg) if peripheral neuropathy developed.
METHODS    				Treatment with zidovudine and prophylaxis of opportunistic infections where indicated.
METHODS    				Response, toxicity and survival.
RESULTS    				Overall, patients had a poor prognosis: 33 out of 46 (72%) had had a previous opportunistic infection, had a mean CD4 count of 144 x 10(6) (20 out of 46 tested) and a mean Karnofsky index of 75.4.
RESULTS    				They received a median of five cycles of therapy: a partial response was achieved in twenty-six patients (57%), disease progression was halted in a further 16 (35%), while disease progression continued in four (9%) despite therapy; there were no complete responders.
RESULTS    				Mean duration of response was 2 months (s.d.,
RESULTS    				1.26 months), survival was 8 months (s.d.,
RESULTS    				6.7 months) from start of therapy and 17 months (s.d.,
RESULTS    				8.9.
RESULTS    				months) from first AIDS diagnosis.
RESULTS    				On multivariate analysis the best predictor of mortality was the presence of previous opportunistic infection (P = 0.00653).
RESULTS    				Side-effects were minimal in comparison with other studies.
RESULTS    				The most common side-effect, in 13 cases (28%), was peripheral neuropathy, which may in part represent the prevalence of HIV neuropathy or remain as background.
RESULTS    				Haematological toxicity was uncommon.
CONCLUSIONS				Treatment for HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma in advanced HIV disease is becoming more necessary as disease profiles change.
CONCLUSIONS				Conventional chemotherapy regimens for malignancy are not well tolerated in these patients and may not be indicated.
CONCLUSIONS				This regimen is effective and has low toxicity in AIDS patients.
CONCLUSIONS				Non-responders should be considered for more intensive regimens.

#### A narrow range, medium molecular weight pentastarch reduces structural organ damage in a hyperdynamic porcine model of sepsis.

OBJECTIVE  				to compare diafiltered 6% pentastarch (Pentafraction--PDP, MWn 120,000 and MWw 280,000) and native pentastarch (Pentaspan--PSP, MWn 63,000 and MWw 264,000 dalton) in a porcine model of faecal peritonitis.
METHODS    				Randomised prospective study in 12 adolescent pigs.
METHODS    				Prior to infection the study solution was infused to increase Qt by 25%.
METHODS    				Thereafter adjustments in infusion rate were made (up to 1 l/h) in an attempt to maintain Qt at 25% above baseline values.
RESULTS    				Animals were sacrificed at 8 h. Tissue was excised from the right lobe of liver and from the right lung and fixed for later electron microscopy and digital morphometric analysis.
RESULTS    				Patent sinusoidal lumen was significantly greater in group PDP compared to PSP (11.3% +/- 2.3% of liver tissue versus 4.8% +/- 1.1%, p < 0.05) and this was accounted for by a significantly lower proportion of sinusoidal lumen occluded with white cells (2.1% +/- 0.6% versus 6.6% +/- 1.9%, p < 0.05).
RESULTS    				Similarly, patent capillary represented a significantly higher proportion of lung tissue for group PDP versus PSP (26.2% +/- 1.9% versus 18.5% +/- 2.7%, p < 0.05).
RESULTS    				The arithmetic mean alveolar capillary barrier thickness was significantly greater in group PSP than in group PDP (4.3 +/- 0.3 microns versus 2.5 +/- 0.3 microns, p < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS				The molecular weight profile of Pentafraction was associated with less structural organ damage including less tissue oedema and less white cell occlusion.

#### Prediction of pregnancy outcome with single versus serial maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests.

OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of our study was to determine whether the trend of three maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein samples was more predictive of pregnancy outcome than the initial sample in the evaluation of patients with unexplained alpha-fetoprotein elevations.
METHODS    				A total of 432 patients with unexplained elevation of their first two maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein samples had a third sample drawn.
METHODS    				Pregnancy outcomes were determined.
METHODS    				Patients were grouped for analysis according to the level of the initial sample, the final sample, and the trend of three samples.
METHODS    				Statistical analysis was by chi 2 and logistic regression, with p < 0.05 considered significant.
RESULTS    				The initial maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein was most predictive of preterm delivery (p < 0.001), size small for gestational age (p < 0.001), and intrauterine fetal death (p = 0.009).
RESULTS    				Neither the final value nor the trend of three values was as prognostic.
CONCLUSIONS				The first maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein is the best predictor of pregnancy outcome.
CONCLUSIONS				Obtaining a second sample to confirm the elevation is appropriate, but additional samples provide minimal information.

#### The intrinsic migratory capacity of memory T cells contributes to their accumulation in rheumatoid synovium.

OBJECTIVE  				Mechanisms controlling the infiltration of T cells into rheumatoid synovium have not been fully characterized.
OBJECTIVE  				These studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between T cell phenotype and migratory capacity, so as to elucidate mechanisms that might contribute to the accumulation of T cells at inflammatory sites.
METHODS    				The characteristics of in vivo migrating cells were studied by dual-immunofluorescence FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) analysis of rheumatoid synovial and peripheral blood T cells.
METHODS    				Migratory cells were also characterized using a recently developed in vitro assay, wherein peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTL) with the capacity to migrate through endothelial cell monolayers were retrieved and assessed.
RESULTS    				Migratory CD4+ T cells from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and normal individuals were characterized as being CD45RA-, CD29bright, CD11abright, L-selectin-, CD54+, and CD58+.
RESULTS    				Migrating RA PBTL (compared with normal PBTL), however, were significantly enriched in activated HLA-DR+ T cells.
RESULTS    				RA synovial tissue lymphocytes exhibited a similar phenotype, but with decreased surface density of CD4 and an increase in HLA-DR and VLA-1.
RESULTS    				RA synovial lymphocytes exhibited a 2-3-fold increase in migratory capacity over normal and RA PBTL:
CONCLUSIONS				These studies demonstrate the inherent migratory proficiency of CD4+ T cells that express a memory phenotype (CD29bright, CD11abright, and CD58+).
CONCLUSIONS				In addition, enhanced transendothelial migration was observed for CD4+ T cells that were CD54+ and L-selectin-.
CONCLUSIONS				These studies demonstrate that the migratory patterns of circulating lymphocytes may be correlated with their surface phenotype and that the intrinsic migratory capacity of memory T cells is one component contributing to their accumulation in the rheumatoid synovium.

#### Inhibition of synovial fluid T cell proliferation by anti-CD5 monoclonal antibodies. A potential mechanism for their immunotherapeutic action in vivo.

OBJECTIVE  				Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against the T cell surface molecule CD5 are able to provide accessory stimulatory signals to resting T cells.
OBJECTIVE  				The potential role of CD5 as an immunoregulatory molecule in inflammatory synovitis was examined.
METHODS    				Synovial fluid and peripheral blood T cells of patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were purified and stimulated with interleukin-2 (IL-2), and the effect of MAb directed against CD5 on IL-2 responsiveness was examined.
RESULTS    				IL-2-induced proliferation of synovial fluid T cells was strongly inhibited by anti-CD5 MAb, but not by anti-CD28 or anti-CD3 MAb.
RESULTS    				In RA peripheral blood T cells, MAb directed against CD5, CD3, and CD28 induced IL-2-dependent T cell growth, similar to findings in healthy controls.
RESULTS    				The difference in activity of anti-CD5 MAb on synovial fluid T cells compared with peripheral blood T cells was not due to different surface expression of CD5.
CONCLUSIONS				Anti-CD5 has an inhibitory effect on in vivo-activated synovial fluid T cells.
CONCLUSIONS				The disease-ameliorative effects of anti-CD5 immunotoxin treatment of RA may be partly due to "switching-off" of T cell activation in the joints.



### 1282009
#### Antilactoferrin antibodies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are associated with vasculitis.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the occurrence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and the specificity of these antibodies (Ab) in serum from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with rheumatoid arthritis complicated by vasculitis (rheumatoid vasculitis [RV]).
METHODS    				ANCA was detected with an indirect immunofluorescence test on ethanol-fixed granulocytes.
METHODS    				Ab against the cytoplasmic antigens proteinase-3, elastase, lactoferrin (LF), and myeloperoxidase were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS    				ANCA were found in the serum of 43% of 49 patients with RV and in 36% of 50 patients with RA.
RESULTS    				Anti-LF Ab occurred more frequently in RV patients (45%) than in RA patients (4%), whereas reactivity against the other cytoplasmic antigens did not differe significantly between these groups.
CONCLUSIONS				Anti-LF Ab in serum of patients with RA may be useful in the diagnosis of vasculitis in RA.

#### HIV-1 biological phenotype and the development of zidovudine resistance in relation to disease progression in asymptomatic individuals during treatment.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine which parameters are associated with clinical progression during zidovudine treatment of asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals.
METHODS    				Twenty-four initially asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals were treated with zidovudine and followed until the development of AIDS or for approximately 3 years.
METHODS    				HIV-1 phenotype was determined by cocultivation of patient cells with donor lymphocytes, and by a new assay of direct cocultivation with MT-2 cells.
METHODS    				Specific mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) gene conferring resistance to zidovudine were detected using a selective polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS    				Progression to AIDS was more rapid in individuals harbouring syncytium-inducing (SI) viral isolates or showing a conversion from non-syncytium-inducing (NSI) to SI viral isolates.
RESULTS    				One out of 20 patients who spent a total of 559 months harbouring an NSI phenotype progressed to AIDS, whereas eight out of 12 patients who spent a total of 223 months harbouring an SI phenotype progressed to AIDS (P < 0.001).
RESULTS    				There was no significant difference between SI and non-SI isolates in the frequency of five mutations causing zidovudine resistance.
RESULTS    				However, all SI isolates obtained after 2 years of treatment contained mutations in codons 41 and 215 of the RT gene, whereas only five out of 11 (45%) NSI isolates obtained at that time had this combination of mutations.
CONCLUSIONS				Conversion to the SI phenotype cannot be prevented by zidovudine treatment.
CONCLUSIONS				The presence or appearance of an SI virus heralded disease progression in zidovudine-treated individuals.
CONCLUSIONS				Further research is required to investigate the relationship between virus phenotype and development of zidovudine resistance.

#### Prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus in patients with various types of liver diseases.

BACKGROUND 				Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is known to be a major cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) and is thought to be an important causative agent of serious liver disease.
BACKGROUND 				Recently the role of HCV in the development of various liver disease is suggested.
METHODS    				Sera from 222 patients with various liver diseases had been kept frozen at -20 degrees C until the test.
METHODS    				Anti-HCV was detected using the ABBOTT HCV EIA Test System (ABBOTT Co., America) following the manufacturer's instructions.
METHODS    				The assay uses a recombinant HCV antigen (C 100-3) synthesized in yeast.
RESULTS    				HCV antibodies (anti-HCV) were detected in 35 (31.5%) of 111 HBsAg-negative patients.
RESULTS    				The prevalence rate of anti-HCV was 61.9% (13 out of 21 patients) in chronic hepatitis, 29.1% (14 out of 48) in liver cirrhosis, 26.3% (5 out of 19) in hepatocellular carcinoma and 13% (3 out of 23) in acute hepatitis was far less (3 out of 111 patients, 2.
RESULTS    				7%) than that of HBsAg-negative patients (p < 0.01).
RESULTS    				In this group, anti-HCV was detected in 2 (5.1%) out of 39 liver cirrhosis, 1 (1.9%) out of 52 chronic hepatitis, among them 47 were biopsy-proven chronic active hepatitis, and none of 20 hepatocellular carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS				These data suggest that, in Korea, 1) coinfection of HCV and HBV is infrequent, 2) HCV might be an important cause of HBsAg-negative chronic hepatitis, 3) HCV is seemed to be a less likely important factor associated with liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in HBsAg-negative patients, but further prospective study with a large population is necessary.

#### DNA fingerprints of Helicobacter pylori before and after treatment with omeprazole.

OBJECTIVE  				To test whether a hypoacidic environment may potentially "stress" Helicobacter pylori DNA, encouraging the emergence of strain variation.
METHODS    				This hypothesis was tested by inducing prolonged hypoacidity with omeprazole, a potent antisecretory drug.
METHODS    				The genomic DNA of H pylori was studied by electrophoretic separation of restriction endonuclease fragments followed by rRNA gene hybridisation in seven patients infected with H pylori before and after treatment with omeprazole 20-40 mg daily for six to eight weeks.
METHODS    				DNA was isolated and purified using the guanidium thiocyanate reagent method.
METHODS    				DNA samples were digested with Hae III, electrophoresed, vacublotted, and hybridised using a biotinylated cDNA probe prepared from 16S and 23S rRNA from H pylori NCTC 11638.
METHODS    				Isolates were compared using their ribopatterns (DNA fingerprints).
RESULTS    				A total of 26 isolates were obtained; all DNA isolates were cut by Hae III, which was the enzyme that gave the best resolved hybridisation patterns for analysis.
RESULTS    				No two patients harboured the same strain.
RESULTS    				The isolates from two patients showed evidence of subtypic variation; one patient had two distinct strains and four patients had their own indistinguishable strains before and after treatment with omeprazole.
RESULTS    				For each patient, the paired ribopatterns of H pylori DNA were not affected by treatment with omeprazole for six to eight weeks.
CONCLUSIONS				The H pylori genome is relatively stable when exposed to the conditions of prolonged hypoacidity that result from treatment with omeprazole.

#### Evaluation of three techniques for differential diagnosis of prostatic needle biopsy specimens.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine whether acidic mucin staining, lectin histochemistry using Wisteria floribunda agglutinin, and immunohistochemistry using the monoclonal antibody EAB 903 are of benefit in distinguishing between hyperplastic and carcinomatous prostatic glandular tissue in needle biopsy specimens.
METHODS    				Formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded prostatic needle biopsy specimens of benign and malignant tissue were examined.
METHODS    				Alcian blue-periodic acid Schiff staining was performed on 33 benign and 34 malignant cases.
METHODS    				Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) binding sites were demonstrated by the avidin-biotin peroxidase (ABC) technique with and without neuraminidase pretreatment on 34 benign cases and 32 malignant cases.
METHODS    				EAB903 anticytokeratin antibody binding sites were demonstrated using both an indirect immunoperoxidase (IIP) technique and an avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method on seven benign and 31 malignant cases.
RESULTS    				Acidic mucin staining was found in 17 of 34 malignant glands and was weakly positive in five of 33 benign glands.
RESULTS    				WFA positivity before neuraminidase pretreatment was present in 29 of 32 malignant glands and in 19 of 34 benign glands.
RESULTS    				After neuraminidase all benign and malignant cases showed positivity.
RESULTS    				EAB 903 positivity was seen in 11 of 31 malignant glands using the IIP technique and in two of 31 malignant glands using the ABC technique.
RESULTS    				In seven benign cases there was positivity in all glands using the IIP method with predominant basal cell staining in three and superficial cell staining in four.
RESULTS    				In benign cases using the ABC method two cases were negative.
CONCLUSIONS				None of the three methods studied showed sufficient sensitivity and specificity to allow their recommendation for routine diagnostic use.

#### Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characterization of tonofilament and hemidesmosome abnormalities in a case of epidermolysis bullosa herpetiformis (Dowling-Meara).

BACKGROUND 				A neonate with epidermolysis bullosa herpetiformis (EBH) (Dowling-Meara) had an undescribed ultrastructural and immunohistochemical abnormality.
OBJECTIVE  				The objective was to clarify the ultrastructural and immunohistochemical abnormalities in EBH to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder.
METHODS    				Tissue from the patient was studied with routine histochemistry, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS    				Excessive clumping of tonofilaments on electron microscopic examination, anomalous hemidesmosomes, and immunohistochemical evidence of aberrant keratin expression by basal epidermal cells was found.
CONCLUSIONS				This case of EBH provides further evidence for primary abnormalities involving cytoskeletal-membrane attachment plaque formation in this rare disorder.

#### [Economic evaluation of prophylaxis with recombinant granulopoiesis stimulating factor].

BACKGROUND 				The aim of the study was to economically evaluate the prophylactic use of the recombinant factor of the stimulation of granulocyte colonies (rG-CSF) for the prevention of episodes of febrile neutropenia (EFN) following antineoplasic chemotherapy.
METHODS    				The methods of economic evaluation used were those of cost analysis and cost-effectivity analysis.
METHODS    				The probability of occurence of EFN was estimated by the application of the Delphi method and the costs were calculated.
RESULTS    				The costs of EFN for the patients with solid tumors is situated between 236,000-377,000 pesetas according to hospitalary centers.
RESULTS    				For patients with acute leukemia the value was estimated as between 391,000-667,000 pesetas.
RESULTS    				The results of the cost analysis indicate that the net cost per patient prophylactically treated is between 4,000-64,000 pesetas.
RESULTS    				The results of the cost-effectivity analysis indicate that the cost per case of no incidence of EFN is between 20,000-320,000 pesetas.
CONCLUSIONS				Episodes of febrile neutropenia carry expansive hospital and antibiotic clinical treatment.
CONCLUSIONS				The prophylactic use of new medication for patients between the first and second cycle of chemotherapy, in agreement with the estimates calculated, does not save health care costs but may improve the quality of life in these patients and permit the continuation of a therapeutic schedule without interruption which may improve the life expectancy of the patient.

#### Outcome of paediatric bacterial meningitis 1979-1989.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the outcome of all cases of paediatric bacterial meningitis over the 11-year period 1979-1989 and discuss the role of adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone.
METHODS    				The study was performed by retrospective case review at Flinders Medical Centre, a general teaching hospital.
RESULTS    				There were 80 episodes in 79 patients.
RESULTS    				The age range was 2 days to 15 years (mean, 1.7 years).
RESULTS    				Haemophilus influenzae type b was the commonest organism (60 of 80 cases; 75%).
RESULTS    				There were five deaths (6.3%).
RESULTS    				Sensorineural hearing loss was found in six of 71 children (8.5%) and was bilateral and severe in four (5.6%).
RESULTS    				Other problems included learning difficulties (12.7%), motor problems (7%), speech delay (7%), hyperactivity (4.2%), blindness (2.8%), obstructive hydrocephalus (2.8%) and recurrent seizures (2.8%).
CONCLUSIONS				Bacterial meningitis remains a disease with significant morbidity and mortality.
CONCLUSIONS				Adjunctive therapy with dexamethasone should be considered, and vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae type b should be routine.

#### High dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation in advanced Hodgkin's disease.

OBJECTIVE  				To present the use of high dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation as salvage therapy for advanced Hodgkin's disease in Australia.
METHODS    				A prospective open study for patients whose disease was resistant to conventional treatment.
METHODS    				The bone marrow transplantation units of four Australian tertiary hospitals.
METHODS    				Seventeen patients (median age 30 years) entered and completed the study.
METHODS    				The stage of the disease at initial diagnosis was I or II (seven patients), III (seven patients) and IV (three patients).
METHODS    				Histological types were lymphocyte predominant (one), nodular sclerosis (12), mixed cellularity (three) and unknown (one).
METHODS    				Therapy before consideration for transplantation included radiotherapy (13), mustine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP--17 patients) or doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD--13 patients) and other chemotherapy regimens (five).
METHODS    				The median interval from diagnosis to transplantation was 29 months (range, 9-178 months).
METHODS    				The patient's disease was classified as sensitive (nine) or resistant (eight) to treatment, depending on the response to the most recent course of chemotherapy.
METHODS    				Morphologically normal autologous bone marrow was harvested and cryopreserved.
METHODS    				The conditioning regimen given was cyclophosphamide, carmustine and etoposide (14) or busulphan and cyclophosphamide (three).
METHODS    				The marrow was then infused.
METHODS    				Remission (complete or partial), disease-free survival and overall survival.
RESULTS    				Over all, 10 of 17 patients (59%) entered or remained in complete remission and four of 17 (24%) achieved partial remission.
RESULTS    				The overall actuarial survival at 30 months was 70%.
RESULTS    				Eight of the nine patients with treatment-sensitive disease (89%) remain disease-free at a median of 22 months (range, 18-29 months) after transplantation.
RESULTS    				Two of the eight patients with resistant disease (25%) are disease-free at 20 and 28 months.
RESULTS    				There was one procedure-related death from haemorrhage and four disease-related deaths at six, seven, eight and 13 months after transplantation.
CONCLUSIONS				Autologous bone marrow transplantation may provide an effective salvage therapy in advanced Hodgkin's disease, particularly for patients with treatment-sensitive disease and a low tumour burden.

#### Phakomatous choristoma of the eyelid. Immunohistochemical and electron microscopic observations.

BACKGROUND 				A 13-month-old Hispanic boy underwent excision of a congenital inferonasal orbital mass arising from the right lower lid.
BACKGROUND 				Results of histopathologic examination of the tumor showed a phakomatous choristoma of the eyelid.
BACKGROUND 				An immunohistochemical and electron microscopic study of this rare, benign, congenital tumor of lenticular anlage was performed.
METHODS    				Immunohistochemistry was performed on 4-microns thick sections from paraffin-embedded tissue.
METHODS    				Electron microscopy was performed on thin sections stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate.
RESULTS    				The cuboidal epithelial cells that comprise this choristoma showed strongly positive cytoplasmic staining with S-100 protein and vimentin and focally positive staining with a keratin cocktail (AE1/AE3).
RESULTS    				Electron microscopy showed the presence of numerous 10-nm whorled cytoplasmic microfilaments within degenerating epithelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS				The immunoreactivity of this tumor to keratin and vimentin are newly described in this detailed clinicopathologic report and, together with its S-100 positivity, support the proposal that this tumor is of lenticular anlage.
CONCLUSIONS				The authors hypothesize that the intracytoplasmic 10-nm intermediate filaments observed with electron microscopic examination within the epithelial cells that comprise this choristoma represent vimentin as detected by immunohistochemistry.

#### 'Hemorrhagic' and microvascular phenomena within the arterial wall.

OBJECTIVE  				To study microvasculature and hemorrhage within the arterial wall.
METHODS    				Human autopsy specimens of the arch of the aorta, the carotid, brachiocephalic, subclavian and coronary arteries perfused with liquid casting material and maintained at physiological pressure until the material had set.
RESULTS    				Evidence of dense microvasculature and other phenomena which have the morphological appearance of 'hemorrhage' within the arterial wall, coupled with calcified matter and other impressions made on the cast by atherosclerotic plaques.
CONCLUSIONS				The findings lend support to suggestions in the literature that neovascularization may play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis and its sequelae, that hemorrhage into the intima may be due to rupture of capillaries which are derived from the coronary lumen, and that an increase in microvasculature occurs in the immediate vicinity of localized atherosclerotic lesions.

#### Significant factors in the disinfection and sterilization of flexible endoscopes.

BACKGROUND 				Many nosocomial infection outbreaks have been linked to improper disinfection of the flexible endoscopes used in hospitals and clinics.
BACKGROUND 				The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of scope disinfection with glutaraldehyde and hydrogen peroxide in manual and mechanical protocols.
METHODS    				Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas cepacia were the test organisms.
METHODS    				Each channel in two different endoscopes was seeded and evaluated separately.
METHODS    				Residual chemical germicide levels in the channels and in the work environment were also measured.
RESULTS    				Parametric analyses were carried out on log transformations of number of colony-forming units recovered.
RESULTS    				Repeated measures analysis demonstrated that both the type of disinfectant and the method of washing were significant factors for disinfection.
CONCLUSIONS				Hydrogen peroxide proved to be more efficacious than glutaraldehyde for killing or removing B. subtilis in a 10-minute contact period.
CONCLUSIONS				Automatic disinfection was more efficacious than manual disinfection for killing or removing B. subtilis in a 10-minute contact period.
CONCLUSIONS				The channel being disinfected also proved to be a significant factor, with carbon dioxide and elevator channels the most difficult to disinfect consistently.

#### Mapping of two new human B-cell epitopes on HIV-1 gp120.

OBJECTIVE  				To map epitopes on gp120 defined by human antibodies and to examine the neutralizing activity of these antibodies.
METHODS    				Serum from HIV-1-antibody-positive individuals was used to screen a random fragment expression library representing gp120 from the HIVIIIB clone BH10.
METHODS    				The library was based on the pUEX1 expression vector.
METHODS    				Serum was tested for in vitro neutralizing activity using H9 cells and the HIVIIIB isolate.
RESULTS    				Four different epitopes defined by human antibodies were mapped on gp120.
RESULTS    				Two of these have not previously been reported and are located within amino acids (aa) 90-100 in the C1 region and aa 355-365 in the semi-conserved region between V3 and V4.
RESULTS    				The other two are located within aa 140-145 and aa 286-309.
RESULTS    				These epitopes are situated in regions that have been shown to demarcate human epitopes.
RESULTS    				Three serum samples with neutralization titres > or = 1024 were identified.
RESULTS    				None of the purified antibody fractions defining the mapped epitopes on gp120 had any neutralizing capacity against HIVIIIB.
CONCLUSIONS				This study is the first demonstration of the applicability of random fragment expression libraries for the direct screening of human serum in order to map epitopes on gp120.
CONCLUSIONS				Two new epitopes and two previously identified epitopes were mapped in this way.
CONCLUSIONS				However, none of the linear epitopes was defined by antibody fractions neutralizing HIVIIIB, and it was not possible to map epitopes defined by neutralizing antibodies in the serum samples capable of neutralizing HIVIIIB infection of H9 cells.
CONCLUSIONS				Thus, it appears that the neutralizing activity of serum in this study was not due to anti-gp120 antibodies defining linear epitopes.

#### The safety and pharmacokinetics of a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, 3TC, in patients with HIV infection: a phase I study.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of the nucleoside analogue, 3TC.
METHODS    				A Phase I, open-label, single-centre study.
METHODS    				Twenty asymptomatic, HIV-infected male patients with CD4 lymphocyte counts < 500 x 10(6)/l who had not received previous antiretroviral therapy completed the study.
METHODS    				Each patient received a single intravenous dose followed by a single oral dose of 3TC.
METHODS    				Four patients were dosed at each of five dose levels (0.25, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg).
RESULTS    				The most commonly reported adverse event was headache, which was generally reported to be mild.
RESULTS    				The mean bioavailability of 3TC was 82% following oral administration.
RESULTS    				The majority of the dose (approximately 70%) was excreted unchanged in the urine.
CONCLUSIONS				Overall, 3TC was well tolerated following dosing, and there were no significant changes in the safety parameters measured.
CONCLUSIONS				Phase I/II clinical trials with 3TC are ongoing to evaluate its safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity.

#### Adriamycin, bleomycin and vincristine chemotherapy with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the maximum tolerated dose of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that would reduce the severity and duration of neutropenia from combination cytotoxic chemotherapy in the treatment of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).
METHODS    				Phase I, dose escalation.
METHODS    				Outpatient clinic of a university hospital.
METHODS    				HIV-seropositive patients with advanced KS.
METHODS    				Combination chemotherapy consisting of adriamycin, bleomycin, and vincristine (ABV), with escalating doses of recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF).
METHODS    				Patients were treated for a median of six cycles (range, between two and seven cycles) of biweekly chemotherapy with GM-CSF administered in divided daily subcutaneous doses on days 2-12.
METHODS    				Serum cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured before, during, and after therapy to correlate with response to therapy.
RESULTS    				A GM-CSF dose of 250 micrograms/m2 was well tolerated, whereas the next dose escalation, of 500 micrograms/m2, was associated with dose-limiting toxicities, including grade 3 fever, fatigue, and diarrhea.
RESULTS    				GM-CSF produced predictable cyclic increases in granulocytes, allowing for delivery of full-dose chemotherapy on schedule.
RESULTS    				All patients were HIV-p24-antigen-negative at study entry; no activation of p24 antigenemia was observed after repeat testing.
RESULTS    				Consistent changes in cytokine levels were not observed.
RESULTS    				Responses included one complete and three partial responses, and two patients with stable disease parameters.
CONCLUSIONS				We conclude that GM-CSF can be administered safely to patients with AIDS-related KS receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, resulting in granulocytic response, without up-regulation of HIV p24 antigen levels in serum.



### 1283521
#### AIDS-associated mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma treated with bleomycin.

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate efficacy and tolerance of bleomycin in AIDS-associated mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma.
OBJECTIVE  				A previous study showed that bleomycin was effective and well tolerated in this setting.
METHODS    				A non-comparative, open, prospective study.
METHODS    				Seventy patients were treated with 5 mg per day intramuscular bleomycin on 3 consecutive days every 2 weeks.
RESULTS    				Two patients achieved a complete response and 50 a partial response (overall response rate, 74%).
RESULTS    				Median time to treatment response was 4 weeks (range, 2-12 weeks) and median time to relapse 10 weeks (range, 2-36 weeks).
RESULTS    				Dose-limiting toxicity consisted of cutaneous adverse reactions.
CONCLUSIONS				Bleomycin is active against AIDS-associated mucocutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma; relapse occurs after discontinuation of therapy.

#### Endothelin, vasopressin, and substance P like immunoreactivity in cultured and intact epithelium from rabbit trachea.

BACKGROUND 				The control of airways reactivity is essential to our understanding of disease processes such as asthma.
BACKGROUND 				Many studies have examined the neural control of the airways, but more recently there has been evidence to show that the epithelium lining the airways may influence airways reactivity.
METHODS    				Rabbit tracheal epithelial cells were dispersed with enzymes, grown in primary culture and fixed.
METHODS    				Tissue from intact tracheas was also sampled and fixed.
METHODS    				Localisation of the vasoactive substances endothelin-1, arginine-vasopressin, and substance P was investigated by immunolabelling techniques.
RESULTS    				Scattered immunolabelling to endothelin-1, arginine-vasopressin, and substance P was found throughout the cultures (with < 20% of cells staining positively to each antibody).
RESULTS    				At the ultrastructural level this immunoreactivity was found in the cytoplasmic matrix.
RESULTS    				In addition, immunoreactivity of intact tissue to endothelin-1, arginine-vasopressin, and substance P was examined and positively staining cells were found to be scattered through the epithelium.
CONCLUSIONS				The presence of these vasoactive substances within the epithelium lining the airways supports the view that epithelial cells may provide an additional mechanism in the control of airways reactivity.



### 1283856
#### Hodgkin's disease: summary of twenty years' experience.

BACKGROUND 				A retrospective analysis on HODGKIN'S DISEASE (HD) was finalized to see if changing the management and therapy during the years we improved the cure rate of lymphomas and reduced the incidence of side effects due to therapy.
BACKGROUND 				Up to twenty years' experience was based in two major therapeutic periods: the first included patients observed between 1970 and June 1980 and the second between July 1980 and December 1987.
BACKGROUND 				Significant differences between the two periods were the reduction of splenectomies as staging procedure, the reduction of radiation dose and extension and the sequential use of MOPP/ABVD instead of MOPP alone.
METHODS    				The analysis included all patients observed over the twenty years under study by looking to the differences concerning response to therapy, survival, relapse-free survival and major consequences due to therapy, namely death not directly related to lymphoma.
METHODS    				377 pts entered the first period and 193 the second one with a minimum follow-up of 4 years.
RESULTS    				Significant differences were recorded on CR rate, 80.9% vs 90.5%, respectively (p = 0.0024) and deaths in CR, 15.1% vs 2.6%, respectively (p = 0.000).
RESULTS    				The overall survival shows a probability of 60% and 83% at 11 years for the first and the second group, respectively (p = 0.000) being the probability of survival of 50% at 20 years for the first group of pts.
RESULTS    				The probability of being in remission is similarly of 79% and 78%, for the first and second group, respectively.
RESULTS    				The risk of death in remission accounting all causes not related to lymphoma shows a 17% probability vs 6% at 11 years (p = 0.006) for the first and second group, respectively, being 38% for the former group at 20 years.
RESULTS    				The most frequent single cause of death in remission was secondary leukemia which was recorded in 14 pts on the group of pts observed between 1970 and 1980, all splenectomized and treated by MOPP and extensive radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS				The modifications of therapy of HD have produced improvements concerning the prognosis of pts; these improvements are due mainly to the reduction of late side effects such as acute leukemia and second solid tumor, and to the increase of remission rate and cure rate of the lymphoma.

#### [Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine profile of 2 different cardiovascular responses in vasodepressor syncope induced by the head-up tilt test].

BACKGROUND 				Syncope in apparently healthy subjects is usually attributed to a vasovagal reaction.
BACKGROUND 				However, a vagal cardio-inhibitory component is not always associated with a vasodepressor component in causing syncope: in fact, increases in heart rate, arterial pressure and plasmatic levels of catecholamines frequently precede loss of consciousness.
METHODS    				Prolonged 60 degrees head-up tilt table test (HUTT) was performed in 50 healthy subjects (27 male, 23 female - mean age 37.2 years) with recurrent syncope of vasodepressor or unknown origin.
METHODS    				The upright-tilt test lasted 45 minutes: every minute of HUTT we measured heart rate (HR) and systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP); at set intervals we took a blood sample to determine epinephrine (EP) and norepinephrine (NEP) levels.
RESULTS    				In patients with positive HUTT (42%) we observed a vaso-vagal response (10 patients) characterized by a sharp drop in SBP and DBP (> 50% of the basal values) and bradycardia (< 40 bpm) and/or sinus node arrests, and a hyperchronotropic-vasodepressor response (11 patients) characterized by a considerable increase in HR (> 60%) and simultaneous drop in SBP and DBP (> 30% of the basal values), and a large increase in plasmal EP (+881.9%).
CONCLUSIONS				According to the Authors, vasovagal response is mainly due to a reflex reaction originating from the cardiac stretch-receptors, whereas hyperchronotropic-vasodepressor response is mainly due to psychic stress and anxiety provoked by prolonged and forced posture during HUTT.
CONCLUSIONS				The high levels of adrenergic activity and plasmal EP cause the excessive chronotropic response and the vasal effects of the syndrome.
CONCLUSIONS				Due to the induction of a state of anxiety and its postural effects, HUTT is a useful provocative tool for complete evaluation of young patients with syncope of vasodepressor origin.
CONCLUSIONS				We treated the patients differently, depending on how they responded to HUTT.
CONCLUSIONS				Those with a vaso-vagal response were treated with alpha-sympathomimetic agents (ethylephrine or mydodrine) and those with a hyperchronotropic-vasodepressor response received non-selective beta-blockers.
CONCLUSIONS				None of our patients had syncope recurrences during a mean follow-up of 12.3 months.
CONCLUSIONS				Only two patients complained of dizziness; in one of them, symptomatology was abolished by an alpha-sympathomimetic beta-blocker association.

#### Antibodies to non-structural hepatitis C virus antigens: a link with liver disease activity?

OBJECTIVE  				The aim of our study was to evaluate the aetiopathogenetic role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the genesis of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma and the relationship between presence of circulating antibodies against non-structural HCV antigens and disease activity.
METHODS    				Using a new enzyme-immunoassay capable of detecting, either separately or together, circulating antibodies to structural and non-structural hepatitis C virus antigens, we tested 208 chronic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carriers and 144 patients suffering from chronic liver disease.
RESULTS    				Among the chronic HBsAg carriers with normal transaminase activity, there were 4% who proved to be anti-HVC positive, compared with 14.5% among those with high serum transaminase.
RESULTS    				Among subjects with chronic liver disease, 20% of patients with chronic persistent hepatitis, 54% with chronic active hepatitis, 35% with liver cirrhosis and 47% with hepatocellular carcinoma proved to be anti-HCV positive.
RESULTS    				With regard to the aetiology of liver disease, 13% and 25% of chronic HBV infected patients, with or without anti-delta virus superinfection respectively, had anti-hepatitis C virus antibody.
RESULTS    				This prevalence was 22% among alcoholic liver disease and 89% among patients with cryptogenic liver diseases.
RESULTS    				The percentage of subjects with circulating antibodies against non-structural HCV proteins was higher among HBsAg chronic carriers with raised alanine aminotransferase and among patients with chronic active hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS				Many subjects with chronic liver disease have circulating anti-HCV antibodies.
CONCLUSIONS				Anti-HCV positive subjects, especially those with antibodies to non-structural antigens, are more frequently found among patients with aggressive liver diseases.
CONCLUSIONS				Among HBsAg chronic carriers the prevalence of anti-HCV was lower in "healthy carriers" and HBeAg positive rather than in HBeAg negative subjects with high alanine aminotransferase.
CONCLUSIONS				We therefore suggest that there may be a relation between HCV replication, activeness of the liver disease and presence of antibodies to non-structural viral antigens.

#### Tricholemmal cysts of the head and neck.

OBJECTIVE  				Tricholemmal cysts, sometimes termed pilomatrixomas, are benign skin neoplasms.
OBJECTIVE  				This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical experience with management of pilomatrixomas at a large, referral-based university hospital.
METHODS    				The records of patients treated at the UCLA Medical Center were reviewed retrospectively.
METHODS    				Patients treated during the years 1966 to 1991 inclusive were reviewed for details of the clinical course.
METHODS    				All pathology slides were confirmed histologically.
RESULTS    				Pilomatrixoma was confirmed in 53 patients.
RESULTS    				Of these, 29 patients (55%) had pilomatrixoma isolated to the head and neck region.
RESULTS    				All were treated with surgical excision.
RESULTS    				One patient (3%) experienced recurrence due to inadequate initial excision.
RESULTS    				Subsequent re-excision resulted in a cure.
CONCLUSIONS				Tricholemmal cysts present as solitary, painless, slow-growing cutaneous nodules often resulting in discoloration of the overlying skin.
CONCLUSIONS				Simple excision cures this benign neoplasm, and recurrences are rare.
CONCLUSIONS				Fine-needle aspiration biopsy may aid in the diagnostic workup.

#### Water precautions in children with tympanostomy tubes.

OBJECTIVE  				The necessity and effectiveness of taking precautions around water with children who have tympanostomy tubes is a source of some controversy among otolaryngologists.
OBJECTIVE  				This study was undertaken to survey the practice standards of otolaryngologists treating these children.
METHODS    				A total of 1,266 board-certified otolaryngologists practicing (mean 14.8 years in practice) in the southern and eastern United States were surveyed to determine current recommendations.
RESULTS    				Among those surveyed, 13.1% forbid children with tympanostomy tubes from swimming, whereas 3.1% feel that no water precautions are needed.
RESULTS    				Limitations are placed in the depth of swimming by 68% and the type of swimming water by 18%.
RESULTS    				The most commonly recommended form of protection is the use of ear plugs, which is favored by 53.4%.
RESULTS    				Liberalization of recommendations concerning the need for water precautions was noted by 79% of respondents who cited personal experience as the single most influential factor.
RESULTS    				An overwhelming percentage of respondents indicated they would be willing to alter their current practice based on new information generated from a clinical trial.
CONCLUSIONS				This survey demonstrates that diversity of opinion does exist among otolaryngologists relative to their recommendations for water precautions after placement of tympanostomy tubes.
CONCLUSIONS				This survey demonstrates the need for a prospective randomized clinical trial designed to address this issue.

#### Lipid and volume analysis of neck drainage in patients undergoing neck dissection.

OBJECTIVE  				We seek to establish normative values for the volume of postoperative neck drainage from patients undergoing ablative oncologic procedures that include a neck dissection and to analyze neck drainage for lipid content to establish guidelines that may be helpful in identifying chylous fistula when this diagnosis is not clinically straightforward.
METHODS    				Neck drainage obtained through continuous suction percutaneous drainage catheters was evaluated following 23 neck dissections performed on 19 patients.
METHODS    				In every case, either radicle or modified type I neck dissection was performed.
METHODS    				The volume of drainage was quantitated on a day-to-day basis.
METHODS    				In a separate group of 27 patients undergoing neck dissection, neck drainage was compared with serum levels of triglyceride, cholesterol, and chylomicron content.
RESULTS    				The mean duration of neck drainage was 5 days.
RESULTS    				Maximum drainage (160 mL) was noted on the first day and dropped daily to less than 10 mL by the fifth postoperative day.
RESULTS    				A statistically significant difference between serum and neck drainage triglyceride and cholesterol content was observed in nearly all cases.
RESULTS    				Neck drainage fat content was lower than that noted in serum in nearly all cases.
RESULTS    				Chylomicron content of 4% was encountered in neck drainage.
CONCLUSIONS				This study provides normative data on lipid content of neck drainage.
CONCLUSIONS				With only a rare exception, the triglyceride and cholesterol levels are higher in the serum than in the neck drainage.
CONCLUSIONS				A triglyceride level of 100 mg/dL seems to be the upper limit of normal (mean plus 1 standard deviation).
CONCLUSIONS				A low level of chylomicron (> 4%) is consistent with normal healing and may be due to breakdown of fatty tissue.

#### High-dose chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE  				This review was undertaken to examine the evidence of effectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (HDC/ABMT) for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer and to compare the magnitudes of the benefits and harms of HDC/ABMT with those of conventional doses of chemotherapy.
METHODS    				Published studies were reviewed and analyzed.
RESULTS    				No randomized controlled trials have been published that evaluate HDC/ABMT.
RESULTS    				Only one internally controlled study has been conducted; it demonstrated that HDC/ABMT and conventional treatment have virtually identical outcomes.
RESULTS    				Comparisons of uncontrolled clinical series are confounded by patient selection and other biases.
RESULTS    				Gross comparisons indicate that, compared with conventional-dose chemotherapy, HDC/ABMT achieves (1) higher complete response rates (36% v 8%), (2) higher overall response rates (70% v 39%), (3) similar median response durations (8 months v 9.6 months), (4) similar median survival durations (16 months v 16.6 months), and (5) similar overall survival rates (eg, 43% 2-year survival v 39%).
RESULTS    				Observations of cases with longer-term disease-free survival are promising but not conclusive.
RESULTS    				High-dose chemotherapy with ABMT has a higher treatment-related mortality rate (5% to 15% v 1%), a high rate of nonmortal toxicity (approximately 30%), and a high rate of side effects (approaching 100%).
CONCLUSIONS				Firm conclusions are not possible because of the lack of controlled studies and the presence of numerous biases.
CONCLUSIONS				However, the existing evidence does not demonstrate that HDC/ABMT is superior to conventional-dose chemotherapy for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
CONCLUSIONS				Randomized controlled trials are needed.

#### Prediction of mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis.

BACKGROUND 				The majority of patients with cystic fibrosis die in early adulthood of lung disease.
BACKGROUND 				Lung transplantation is a treatment option for patients with advanced pulmonary disease, although the waiting period for organs may be as long as two years.
BACKGROUND 				Our purpose was to determine whether the risk of death due to respiratory failure could be predicted one or two years in advance on the basis of pulmonary function, blood gas levels, and nutritional status.
METHODS    				The study cohort consisted of 673 patients followed between 1977 and 1989.
METHODS    				In each patient, pulmonary function, blood gas levels, nutritional status, and vital status were assessed between 1977 and 1987.
METHODS    				Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was used to compute the relative risk of death within one or two years after particular measurements.
METHODS    				The effects of age and sex on mortality were also included in the analysis.
RESULTS    				One hundred ninety patients (28 percent) died during the study period.
RESULTS    				Overall, patients with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) less than 30 percent of the predicted value, a partial pressure of arterial oxygen below 55 mm Hg, or a partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide above 50 mm Hg had two-year mortality rates above 50 percent.
RESULTS    				Among the laboratory measurements, the FEV1 was the most significant predictor of mortality, but age and sex were also significant in predicting risk.
RESULTS    				After adjustment for age and sex, the relative risk of death within two years was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 2.2) for each decrement in the FEV1 of 10 percent below the predicted value.
RESULTS    				Among patients with the same FEV1, the relative risk of death was 2.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 2.6) in patients 10 years younger than other patients, and 2.2 (1.6 to 3.1) in female patients as compared with male patients.
CONCLUSIONS				Patients with cystic fibrosis should be considered candidates for lung transplantation when the FEV1 falls below 30 percent of the predicted value.
CONCLUSIONS				Female patients and younger patients may need to be considered for transplantation at an earlier stage.

#### Comparative efficacy of alternative hand-washing agents in reducing nosocomial infections in intensive care units.

BACKGROUND 				Effective hand-washing can prevent nosocomial infections, particularly in high-risk areas of the hospital.
BACKGROUND 				There are few clinical studies of the efficacy of specific hand-cleansing agents in preventing the transmission of pathogens from health care workers to patients.
METHODS    				For eight months, we conducted a prospective multiple-crossover trial involving 1894 adult patients in three intensive care units (ICUs).
METHODS    				In a given month, the ICU used a hand-washing system involving either chlorhexidine, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, or 60 percent isopropyl alcohol with the optional use of a nonmedicated soap; in alternate months the other system was used.
METHODS    				Rates of nosocomial infection and hand-washing compliance were monitored prospectively.
RESULTS    				When chlorhexidine was used, there were 152 nosocomial infections, as compared with 202 when the combination of alcohol and soap was used (adjusted incidence-density ratio [IDR], 0.73; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.90).
RESULTS    				The largest reduction with chlorhexidine was in gastrointestinal infections (IDR, 0.19; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.05 to 0.64).
RESULTS    				When chlorhexidine was available, the rates of nosocomial infection declined in each of the ICUs, and health care workers washed their hands more often than when alcohol and soap were used (relative risk, 1.28; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.60).
RESULTS    				The total volume of alcohol and soap used was 46 percent that of chlorhexidine (P less than 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS				A hand-disinfection system using an antimicrobial agent (chlorhexidine) reduces the rate of nosocomial infections more effectively than one using alcohol and soap.
CONCLUSIONS				The improvement may be explained at least in part by better compliance with hand-washing instructions when chlorhexidine was used.

#### Validating the SF-36 health survey questionnaire: new outcome measure for primary care.

OBJECTIVE  				To test the acceptability, validity, and reliability of the short form 36 health survey questionnaire (SF-36) and to compare it with the Nottingham health profile.
METHODS    				Postal survey using a questionnaire booklet together with a letter from the general practitioner.
METHODS    				Non-respondents received two reminders at two week intervals.
METHODS    				The SF-36 questionnaire was retested on a subsample of respondents two weeks after the first mailing.
METHODS    				Two general practices in Sheffield.
METHODS    				1980 patients aged 16-74 years randomly selected from the two practice lists.
METHODS    				Scores for each health dimension on the SF-36 questionnaire and the Nottingham health profile.
METHODS    				Response to questions on recent use of health services and sociodemographic characteristics.
RESULTS    				The response rate for the SF-36 questionnaire was high (83%) and the rate of completion for each dimension was over 95%.
RESULTS    				Considerable evidence was found for the reliability of the SF-36 (Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.85, reliability coefficient greater than 0.75 for all dimensions except social functioning) and for construct validity in terms of distinguishing between groups with expected health differences.
RESULTS    				The SF-36 was able to detect low levels of ill health in patients who had scored 0 (good health) on the Nottingham health profile.
CONCLUSIONS				The SF-36 is a promising new instrument for measuring health perception in a general population.
CONCLUSIONS				It is easy to use, acceptable to patients, and fulfils stringent criteria of reliability and validity.
CONCLUSIONS				Its use in other contexts and with different disease groups requires further research.

#### Survival rates with coronary artery disease for black women compared with black men.

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the influence of gender on the prognosis of coronary heart disease among black patients.
METHODS    				Cohort study based on a consecutive sample from a hospital registry, with a mean follow-up of 4 years.
METHODS    				An inner-city public hospital in Chicago, Ill.
METHODS    				The study included 1719 consecutive black patients (780 men and 939 women) who had any one of the following events: cardiac catheterization for presumed coronary heart disease, hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction, or coronary artery bypass grafting.
RESULTS    				Hospital and operative mortality rates following acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass grafting were similar between the two sexes.
RESULTS    				The relative risks for cardiac death in women vs men were 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 1.28), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.53 to 1.17), and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.34 to 1.85) for coronary artery disease, acute myocardial infarction, and coronary artery bypass grafting, respectively, after adjusting for age, history of diabetes, hypertension, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction, number of diseased vessels, and ejection fraction.
RESULTS    				Compared with patients of the same sex with normal angiograms, relative risk estimates were 5.0, 10.1, and 6.3 for women and were 1.8, 4.0, and 2.0 for men in the same three groups of patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS				Survival with coronary artery disease in black women is similar to that observed in black men, but relative to members of the same sex without the disease, the prognosis for women is considerably worse than for men.

#### Analysis of T-lymphocyte subsets after phytohemagglutinin stimulation in normal and type 1 diabetic mothers and their infants.

OBJECTIVE  				Our aim was to investigate the immunological status of diabetic pregnancy, which is an overlap of diabetic immunity abnormalities and the immunological modifications normally occurring during pregnancy.
METHODS    				We studied lymphocyte subpopulations and lymphokine production, after 96 h of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation, from normal and Type I diabetic pregnant women at delivery time and from the respective cord blood.
RESULTS    				Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from both normal and Type I diabetic mothers showed an increase in CD8+ and a decrease in CD4+ cells compared to the respective cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC).
RESULTS    				Moreover, Type I PBMC showed a lower number of "activated" CD3+ DR+ cells and a higher number of CD8+ CD25+ cells with respect to normal women, which may reflect the dysregulatory pattern due to the autoimmune condition.
RESULTS    				Type I CBMC showed a big increase in the number of CD4+ Leu8+ cells, a cell subpopulation characterized by inhibitory activity.
RESULTS    				Finally, as regards lymphokine release in culture supernatants, type I diabetes seemed to be associated with an over-production of IL1 and IL6, although the latter increase is less evident in CBMC cultures.
CONCLUSIONS				The present study shows that diabetic pregnancy is associated with major alterations of cell-mediated immunity leading to a state of immunodepression.
CONCLUSIONS				Moreover, our study suggests that the maternal immunological status influences fetal immunity, as demonstrated by the increase in the number of regulatory cells and by the altered pattern of lymphokine production (IL1 and IL6) by lymphocytes derived from diabetic CBMC.
CONCLUSIONS				The latter phenomenon perfectly mirrors maternal PBMC characteristics.

#### Effect of labor on lymphocyte subsets in full-term neonates.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the effect of labor on lymphocyte subsets in full-term neonates.
METHODS    				Cord blood obtained at delivery from full-term neonates, six born vaginally and six born by elective Cesarean section, was analyzed for lymphocyte subsets.
METHODS    				Monoclonal antibodies, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry were utilized to determine the lymphocyte phenotype frequencies in these neonates.
METHODS    				These frequencies were compared by mode of delivery and to adult peripheral blood reference ranges using a two-tailed Student's t-test, P < 0.05.
RESULTS    				A profile of significantly elevated T (CD2, CD3) and helper cells (CD4) and depressed Natural Killer cells (CD16, CD56) is characteristic of term Cesarean section neonates.
RESULTS    				Significantly depressed frequency of T cells (CD2, CD3) and helper T cells (CD4) and elevated Natural Killer cells (CD16, CD56) is characteristic of vaginally delivered neonates.
CONCLUSIONS				The mode of delivery affects the lymphocyte subset frequencies in full-term neonates.

#### Development and distribution of the white blood cells within various structures of the human menstrual corpus luteum examined using an image analysis system.

OBJECTIVE  				Emerging evidences suggest that immunoendocrine interactions play definitive roles during development and regression of the human menstrual corpus luteum (hmCL).
OBJECTIVE  				We have studied the distribution of immune cells within individual structures of hmCL during various stages of its development.
METHODS    				Immunoperoxidase-stained ultra-thin frozen sections were evaluated using light microscopy fitted with an image analysis system.
RESULTS    				The results suggest that monocytes/macrophages and MHC class II positive cells are the most prominent immune cells within the hmCL throughout its whole lifespan.
RESULTS    				Both cell types are concentrated within the trabeculae.
RESULTS    				In addition, MHC class II positive cells are abundant also within the granulosa-luteal layer.
RESULTS    				T helper/inductor (Th/i) and T cytotoxic/suppressor (Tc/s) cells were detected only in minor amounts within the thecal trabeculae of mature tissue.
CONCLUSIONS				Possible links between the occurrence and functional roles of the immune cells studied are discussed.

#### Identification of lymphocyte subsets in the human fallopian tube.

OBJECTIVE  				Immunohistochemical investigations for the detection of lymphocyte subsets in the human oviduct have been performed.
OBJECTIVE  				Knowledge about local immunity especially cell-mediated immunity, in the fallopian tube has been, up to now, limited.
OBJECTIVE  				As an essential structure for the human reproduction process, the tubal mucous membrane is exposed to a variety of antigens.
METHODS    				A total number of 20 tubal biopsies obtained from fertile women during gynecological operations like tubal ligations or hysterectomy were examined by the immunoperoxidase technique.
METHODS    				Seven specimens were obtained during the proliferative phase, ten during the secretory phase and three during a caesarean section with tubal ligations.
RESULTS    				It could be established that the presence of lymphocytes in the oviductal mucous membrane is physiological.
RESULTS    				These cells can be identified by their typical immunohistochemical patterns.
RESULTS    				There were no significant differences of the type and number of lymphocytes in the mucosa within the phases of menstrual cycle.
RESULTS    				The dominant cell types in the tubal mucosa were the CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes.
CONCLUSIONS				It can be suggested that the lymphocytes in the tubal mucosa may involved in the process of immune tolerance, which could realize the transport of sperms and blastocysts through the oviduct under normal conditions without activation of local immune mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS				The lymphoid tissue of the oviduct is a specialized form of mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

#### The leukocytic reaction of the human uterine cervix.

OBJECTIVE  				Sperm interaction with the immune system of the human cervix is poorly understood.
METHODS    				The leukocytic response of the human cervix to sperm was examined in a closely monitored patient population (N = 10), using monoclonal antibody cell identification techniques.
METHODS    				Baseline data were collected from both cervical mucus and smears sampled before treatment by donor insemination.
METHODS    				Donor insemination was timed to coincide with ovulation by monitoring plasma LH concentrations twice daily.
METHODS    				Following insemination the numbers of leukocytes were recorded in cervical mucus and smear samples taken over a 24-h period relative to the time of treatment.
METHODS    				Controls treated with "pure sperm," seminal plasma, cryopreservative, and cervical smearing alone were also included in the study.
RESULTS    				Only those women treated with sperm cells exhibited substantial elevations in leukocyte numbers following inseminations.
RESULTS    				Additionally, serial cervical smearing induced an inflammatory response of the cervix.
RESULTS    				In all the women, the neutrophil was the predominant leukocyte of the cervix both during the baseline and treatment periods (median values ranged from 77 to 86%).
RESULTS    				Macrophages, T-helper lymphocytes, and T-suppressor lymphocytes were also detected, but only in low numbers (2-10.6%).
RESULTS    				Two patients and one control ("pure sperm") became pregnant during their study cycle.
CONCLUSIONS				We conclude that the leukocytic reaction is a physiological response of the cervix to sperm, the function of which remains to be established.

#### Coronariographic significance of heart rate variation related to ischemic episodes in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery.

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the characteristics of myocardial ischemia during daily life and their coronariographic significance in a group of patients with proven coronary artery disease undergoing peripheral vascular surgery.
METHODS    				Department of Cardiology--Central Hospital--Lisbon.
METHODS    				In 14 patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery and in whom coronariography revealed coronary significative lesions, Holter monitoring was performed during a 24-hour period.
METHODS    				Two groups of ischemic episodes were considered: Group A constituted by 44 episodes detected in patients with left main or three vessel disease and group B by 12 episodes detected in patients with one ot two vessel disease.
METHODS    				In each group the ischemic parameters were studied.
RESULTS    				The incidence of myocardial ischemia was 64%.
RESULTS    				Statistically significant differences were observed between group A and B concerning the mean heart rate variation from two minutes before the onset of ST-segment depression to its onset (2.39 bpm vs 8.75 bpm; p < 0.05), from the onset of ST-segment depression to its maximal depression (4.43 bpm vs 16.67 bpm; p < 0.001) and from two minutes before St-segment depression to its maximal depression (6.82 bpm vs 25.4 bpm; p < 0.00001).
RESULTS    				No differences were found in duration and maximal ST-segment depression.
CONCLUSIONS				Particular characteristics of heart rate variation related to the ischemic episodes seem to have a relation with the severity of coronary artery disease in patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery.

#### Enantiomer-specific effects of an intravenously administered arrhythmogenic dose of bupivacaine on neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius and the cardiovascular system in the anesthetized rat.

OBJECTIVE  				This investigation was designed to determine whether the effects on the cell firing rate (CFR) at the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) and on the cardiovascular system, which are associated with a toxic dose of bupivacaine, have an enantiomer-specific component.
METHODS    				Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with chloral hydrate, and a femoral artery and vein were cannulated.
METHODS    				After the cranial surface was exposed, a 3-mm hole was drilled 2 mm caudal and 1.5 mm lateral with respect to lambda for placement of a 1-microns tungsten microelectrode.
METHODS    				Cells of the NTS were located 6-6.5 mm from the brain surface, and CFR was continuously recorded.
METHODS    				Lead II electrocardiogram and arterial blood pressure were also recorded.
METHODS    				Twenty-four animals received either d- or l-bupivacaine (2 mg/kg) in random order.
RESULTS    				Cell firing rates decreased from 21 +/- 13 to 0 +/- 0 impulses/second (p < 0.001) at 34 +/- 15 seconds after the injection of d-bupivacaine.
RESULTS    				Cell firing rates decreased from 22 +/- 17 to 2 +/- 4 impulses/second (p < 0.01) at 68 +/- 45 seconds after injection of l-bupivacaine.
RESULTS    				In addition to the decreases in blood pressure and heart rate that were found, all animals exhibited an inversion in electrical axis beginning within 2-3 seconds after bupivacaine administration.
RESULTS    				Mild bradycardia was noted in four of the animals receiving the l-bupivacaine, whereas severe bradycardia was observed in all animals receiving d-bupivacaine.
RESULTS    				Most important, this severe bradycardia was accompanied by progressive hypotension.
RESULTS    				In addition, all animals receiving d-bupivacaine became apneic and died, whereas all animals receiving l-bupivacaine continued to breathe and all but two of the animals survived.
CONCLUSIONS				Data in the current report support the hypothesis that effects of bupivacaine on neurons of the NTS and on the cardiovascular system have an enantiomer-specific component.

#### Distribution of 3H-morphine after lumbar epidural administration in unanesthetized rabbits.

OBJECTIVE  				This study focused on the distribution of 3H-morphine in the spinal cord, roots, urine, and blood, after epidural administration in rabbits.
METHODS    				Under nitrous oxide, halothane, and oxygen endotracheal anesthesia, the cisterna magna of New Zealand albino rabbits was cannulated for cerebrospinal fluid sampling, and catheters were placed in the lumbar epidural space.
METHODS    				Through the epidural catheter, 200 pmol of 3H-morphine contained in 500 microliters of 1.3 mM (0.21 mg) morphine was injected.
METHODS    				Arterial blood and cisternal CSF were sampled at 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after injection.
METHODS    				Animals were killed with intravenous pentobarbital at the end of 120 minutes (n = 3), 6 hours (n = 4), and 12 hours (n = 2).
METHODS    				In each animal the brain, spinal cord, spinal roots, liver, kidneys, and urinary bladder were removed.
RESULTS    				The injection site over the cord was identified and all tissues were immediately frozen at -70 degrees C. Two-mm thick cross-sections, were taken from every centimeter of the spinal cord.
RESULTS    				Radioactivity in the series of sections was determined by scintillation spectroscopy.
RESULTS    				At 2 hours, 4.2% +/- 1.1% of the injected radioactivity was recovered, and at 6 hours 1.6% +/- 0.6% was recovered.
RESULTS    				Radioactivity was concentrated mainly around the lumbar injection site, and it decreased as the distance increased from the injection site and coincided with elapsed time after the injection.
CONCLUSIONS				Multiple linear regression analysis of radioactive labels showed the significant effect of time, distance from the injection site, and the time-distance interaction on the distribution of 3H-morphine in the spinal cord (p < 0.0001 for time and rostral and caudal distance from the injection site; and p < 0.0001 for interaction between time and distance.)
CONCLUSIONS				A major portion of the injected radioactivity was recovered in the urine and a small amount in other tissues and body fluid: bladder, liver, spinal roots, kidney, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid.

#### Thoracic paravertebral block in chronic postoperative pain.

OBJECTIVE  				Chronic postoperative pain in thoracic dermatomes is common.
OBJECTIVE  				The most frequently used methods of pain relief in this area are posterior multidermatomal intercostal nerve or thoracic epidural blocks.
OBJECTIVE  				Compared with these methods, thoracic paravertebral block may have some advantages.
OBJECTIVE  				Usually only one injection is needed, and the use of larger volumes of local anesthetic (up to 25 ml) results in widespread unilateral analgesia including sympathetic block without the potential risk of hypotension and motor block associated with epidural block.
METHODS    				We retrospectively analyzed 281 thoracic paravertebral blocks performed for chronic postoperative pain (post-thoracotomy and postmastectomy) from 1986 to 1990 in our pain clinic.
RESULTS    				In post-thoracotomy group, patients were without pain for at least a month after 58% of the blocks; in 30%, the effect lasted for at least two months; in 8%, more than four months and, in 3%, more than five months.
RESULTS    				In 88% of patients with postmastectomy pain, the achieved pain relief with thoracic paravertebral block was less than a month.
RESULTS    				No severe complications occurred.
CONCLUSIONS				Thoracic paravertebral block proved to be a reliable and safe technique for unilateral pain relief in chronic post-thoracotomy pain.

#### Why Londoners have low death rates from ischaemic heart disease and stroke.

OBJECTIVE  				To explain the low death rates from cardiovascular disease in London.
METHODS    				London and the other counties of England and Wales.
METHODS    				Women living in London during 1901-10 and people in London dying during 1968-78.
RESULTS    				At the beginning of the twentieth century young women aged 15-34 in London had remarkably low death rates, largely because of low rates for tuberculosis and other infectious diseases and low mortality during childbirth.
RESULTS    				Their low death rates contrasted with the high rates in girls under 15 years.
CONCLUSIONS				Large numbers of young women had migrated into London from agricultural counties in southern England and went into domestic service, where the diet was usually very good.
CONCLUSIONS				Recent findings suggest that a mother's nutrition and health has a major effect on the risk of cardiovascular disease in the next generation.
CONCLUSIONS				The low cardiovascular mortality in London is consistent with this, and contrasts with the high mortality from other common diseases.

#### Noise and the classical musician.

OBJECTIVE  				To test the hypothesis that noise exposure may cause hearing loss in classical musicians.
METHODS    				Comparison of hearing levels between two risk groups identified during the study by measuring sound levels.
METHODS    				Symphony orchestra and occupational health department in the west Midlands.
METHODS    				Hearing level as measured by clinical pure tone audiometry.
RESULTS    				Trumpet and piccolo players received a noise dose of 160% and 124%, respectively, over mean levels during part of the study.
RESULTS    				Comparison of the hearing levels of 18 woodwind and brass musicians with 18 string musicians matched for age and sex did not show a significant difference in hearing, the mean difference in the hearing levels at the high (2, 4, and 8 KHz) audiometric frequencies being 1.02 dB (95% confidence interval -2.39 to 4.43).
CONCLUSIONS				This study showed that there is a potential for occupational hearing loss in classical orchestral musicians.

#### Does earwax lose its pathogens on your auriscope overnight?

OBJECTIVE  				To describe the organisms cultured from general practitioners' auriscope earpieces; and to explore general practitioners' perceptions of the possibility of cross infection from contaminated auriscope earpieces and of how their auriscope earpieces are cleaned.
METHODS    				Microbiological survey of auriscope earpieces in two general practices and a semistructured questionnaire sent to 105 general practitioners.
METHODS    				General practitioners served by one district general hospital microbiology laboratory in the north of England.
RESULTS    				Organisms were cultured from 41 (93%) of 44 auriscope earpieces, of which 14 (32%) carried potential pathogens; four (9%) were heavily contaminated.
RESULTS    				Of the 85 (81%) general practitioners who responded, 72 (85%) believed that contaminated auriscope earpieces could cause serious infection, 66 (78%) did not clean earpieces between patients, and 70 (82%) thought that patients would mind if they knew that dirty earpieces were used.
CONCLUSIONS				Almost a third of auriscope earpieces were contaminated by pathogenic bacteria.
CONCLUSIONS				Although general practitioners suspected this, most did not ensure that a clean earpiece was used for each patient.

#### Morbidity in patients on L-thyroxine: a comparison of those with a normal TSH to those with a suppressed TSH.

OBJECTIVE  				Patients on L-thyroxine with a 'suppressed' TSH (< 0.05 mU/l) were compared to those in whom TSH was detectable but not elevated (0.05-4.0 mU/l), with regard to morbidity data.
METHODS    				Biochemical data from Tayside Thyroid Register was matched to hospital admissions data obtained from Health Board Statistics.
METHODS    				The patients were identified from those registered on the computerized Tayside Register.
METHODS    				Serum T4 and TSH assays, clinical assessment scores, and admission records with regard to ischaemic heart disease, overall fractures, fractured neck of femur and breast carcinoma.
RESULTS    				Over one year, 1180 patients on thyroxine replacement had clinical and biochemical assessment; 59% had a suppressed TSH and 38% 'normal' TSH.
RESULTS    				Patients with a suppressed TSH exhibited higher median serum thyroxine levels (146 nmol/l, range 77-252 vs 119 nmol/l, 58-224; P < 0.001).
RESULTS    				Patients under the age of 65 years on L-thyroxine had an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease compared to the general population (female 2.7 vs 0.7%, P < 0.001; male 6.4 vs 1.7%, P < 0.01), but the risk was no different between those with suppressed and normal TSH.
RESULTS    				There was no increase in risk for overall fracture, fractured neck of femur or breast carcinoma in those on thyroxine with suppressed or normal TSH.
CONCLUSIONS				Patients under the age of 65 years on L-thyroxine had an increased risk of ischaemic heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS				There was no excess of fractures in patients on L-thyroxine even if the TSH is suppressed.

#### Circadian changes in pulsatile TSH release in primary hypothyroidism.

OBJECTIVE  				We evaluated pulsatile and circadian TSH secretion in primary hypothyroidism.
METHODS    				In a prospective study, blood was sampled every 10 minutes during 24 hours for assay of TSH (IRMA).
METHODS    				Thyroid hormones and TSH responsiveness to TRH were then measured.
METHODS    				Nine patients with overt primary hypothyroidism, seven patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and 16 healthy controls.
METHODS    				Computer-assisted analysis by the Desade and Cluster programs.
RESULTS    				Both computer-assisted programs revealed an increased TSH pulse amplitude in both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism versus controls (Desade: 36.9 +/- 31.4 (mean +/- SD) (P < 0.001) and 2.8 +/- 1.9 (P < 0.001) vs 0.4 +/- 0.2 mU/l; Cluster: 25.6 +/- 25.1 (P < 0.001) and 2.4 +/- 1.4 (P < 0.001) vs 0.4 +/- 0.2 mU/l).
RESULTS    				TSH pulse frequency remained unchanged with approximately 10 pulses/24 hours.
RESULTS    				A highly significant correlation was found between the mean 24-hour TSH concentration and the TSH pulse amplitude in all controls and patients but not to TSH pulse frequency.
RESULTS    				The nocturnal TSH surge was absent in six out of nine patients with overt primary hypothyroidism.
RESULTS    				The deficient nocturnal rise of TSH in primary hypothyroidism vs controls (22 +/- 51 vs 82 +/- 41%, P < 0.001), was associated with a loss of the usual nocturnal increase in TSH pulse amplitude and frequency.
CONCLUSIONS				Mean 24-hour TSH pulse amplitude is increased in primary hypothyroidism, but TSH pulse frequency remains unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS				The decrease of the nocturnal TSH increase in primary hypothyroidism is associated with a loss of the usual nocturnal increase in TSH pulse amplitude and frequency.

#### Circadian rhythm and pulsatility of parathyroid hormone secretion in man.

OBJECTIVE  				We wished to investigate the circadian rhythm and pulsatility of parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in man, as conflicting results have been published.
METHODS    				To investigate the circadian rhythm during daytime, we sampled (a) peripheral blood at hourly intervals in 12 healthy young men from 0900 h until 1700 h. For observation of pulsatility, we sampled (b) peripheral blood at 1-minute intervals for 1 hour in three healthy men and three healthy women (mean 27.7 years, range 21-56 years) and (c) at 1-minute intervals for 30 minutes in 21 patients with surgically confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT).
METHODS    				The serum levels of intact PTH were measured by two-site immunoradiometric assay and special care was taken to reduce intra-assay variability, especially at the normal PTH concentration.
METHODS    				In series (a), ionized calcium, total calcium and phosphate were also determined.
RESULTS    				A circadian rhythm during daytime was found for intact PTH in healthy men and women with a nadir at 0930 h and a peak in the afternoon.
RESULTS    				Ionized calcium and total calcium (protein-adjusted) decreased and phosphate increased in the afternoon.
RESULTS    				These changes were all statistically significant (P < 0.02).
RESULTS    				Pulsatility of PTH: Statistical cluster analysis of the data showed no pulsatility either in healthy persons or in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.
RESULTS    				In two healthy women and one healthy man slight changes of longer duration were discovered, but no complete pulses.
RESULTS    				In five patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, larger differences between the highest and lowest concentrations of intact PTH were found, but no complete pulses.
CONCLUSIONS				Our data show a significant circadian rhythm during daytime of intact PTH and only minor changes from minute to minute.
CONCLUSIONS				The alterations in PTH-levels occurred at longer time intervals in healthy persons.
CONCLUSIONS				In some patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, decreases of PTH-levels were found.
CONCLUSIONS				The circadian rhythm of PTH may be due to slight changes in calcium or phosphate concentration.

#### The effects of opioid blockade and GnRH administration upon luteinizing hormone secretion in patients with anorexia nervosa during the stages of weight loss and weight recovery.

OBJECTIVE  				We examined the functional status of the hypothalamic-opioid system involved in LH secretion and the pituitary LH sensitivity and reserve in patients with anorexia nervosa were studied during body weight loss and weight recovery.
OBJECTIVE  				We measured the temporal relationship between weight recovery, expression of hypothalamic-opioid activity and pituitary GnRH responsiveness, and resumption of ovulatory cycles.
METHODS    				Five patients with anorexia nervosa were prospectively studied during weight loss and amenorrhoea, subsequently when they reached their ideal body weight but still remained amenorrhoeic and thereafter every 6 months until resumption of ovulatory cycles; one patient was studied only during weight loss, two during ideal body weight and amenorrhoea and one during ideal body weight and ovulatory cycles.
METHODS    				Blood was sampled every 10 minutes over a 16-hour period on two alternate days.
METHODS    				On study day 1 (control day), patients received two sets of saline infusion every 6 hours and one saline bolus at the beginning of the seventh hour; on study day 3 (experimental day), they received a saline infusion during the first 6 hours, an intravenous bolus of naloxone (20 mg) at the beginning of the seventh hour and then a continuous naloxone infusion (1.6 mg per hour) during the ensuing 6 hours.
METHODS    				Pituitary LH sensitivity and reserve were assessed on both study days by the subsequent administration of 5 and 95 micrograms of GnRH 4 hours before the completion of each sampling period.
METHODS    				Patients in ideal body weight and ovulatory cycles as well as five normal menstruating women included in the study for comparative purposes, were studied during the midluteal phase of a cycle.
METHODS    				LH, oestradiol and progesterone were determined by radioimmunoassay.
METHODS    				Areas under the LH curve were calculated by the trapezoid method; LH pulse detection was carried out by the program Cluster.
RESULTS    				Naloxone administration to patients with anorexia nervosa in the weight loss phase, did not significantly modify their serum LH levels nor the characteristics of its pulsatile secretion.
RESULTS    				Administration of the opioid blocker induced a significant increase in serum LH concentrations only in those patients in ideal body weight and amenorrhoea who resumed ovulatory cycles within the 6 months following the last study as well as in patients with an ideal body weight and ovulatory cycles and in normal controls.
RESULTS    				All patients and subjects who responded to naloxone administration exhibited significant increases in the area under the LH curve, mean LH pulse amplitude and peak area.
RESULTS    				Patients in ideal body weight and amenorrhoea who did not resume ovulatory cycles within the 6 months following the study days, did not respond to naloxone administration.
RESULTS    				There were no significant correlations between the magnitude of LH response to naloxone administration and the baseline levels of serum oestradiol and progesterone.
RESULTS    				All patients exhibited significant pituitary LH responses to both GnRH doses, regardless of the stage of the disease; however, the pituitary responsiveness shown by patients in ideal body weight was significantly higher than that presented by patients in weight loss.
RESULTS    				There were no significant differences between the responses to GnRH exhibited by patients in ideal body weight and amenorrhoea who responded to naloxone administration and those shown by patients in the same clinical condition but who were insensitive to opioid blockade.
CONCLUSIONS				The re-establishment of hypothalamic-opioid inhibitory activity involved in LH secretion in patients with anorexia nervosa during the phase of weight gain predicts imminent restoration of ovulatory cycles.
CONCLUSIONS				Pituitary LH response to exogenous GnRH during weight recovery does not accurately predict the outcome of the disease regarding reinitiation of menstrual cycles; however, it might be an indicator that the normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is being restored.

#### The empty sella: results of treatment in 76 successive cases and high frequency of endocrine and neurological disturbances.

OBJECTIVE  				We assessed the frequency of endocrine or neurological disturbances and the results of surgery in patients with empty sella, diagnosed with cisternography and/or computerized tomography scanning.
METHODS    				Analysis of hospital records of 76 successive patients (73 primary, three secondary empty sella) from a single institution.
METHODS    				Clinical and neuro-ophthalmological evaluation.
METHODS    				Serum PRL, GH, TSH, LH, FSH, T4, T3 by radioimmunoassay.
METHODS    				Diagnosis of empty sella with cisternography and/or computerized tomography scanning (n = 69), or discovered at surgery (n = 7).
RESULTS    				Patients with empty sella had: headache (69.7%), visual disturbances (34.2%), cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea (11.8%), endocrine disturbances (51.4%, including hyperprolactinaemia, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome).
RESULTS    				A pituitary tumour was discovered in two patients, in seven other ones it was suspected but not found at surgery.
RESULTS    				Transsphenoidal packing of empty sellas was done in 56 cases, with 7.1% post-operative complications.
RESULTS    				With surgery there was improvement of headache in 71%, of visual disturbances in 46%.
RESULTS    				Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea (discovered at surgery in four other patients) was not resolved by the first operation in six out of 13 patients.
RESULTS    				In 20 patients without surgery, headache improved in 64.6%.
CONCLUSIONS				The empty sella is frequently associated with a variety of neurological and endocrine disturbances, which is contrary to conventional belief.
CONCLUSIONS				Cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhoea is not a rare complication and it may be difficult to treat.
CONCLUSIONS				Some cases of empty sella may be due to partial pituitary apoplexy.
CONCLUSIONS				Autoimmunity may have existed in other cases.
CONCLUSIONS				Surgery may be useful in many patients, but a judicious selection is needed because it entails complications and non-operated patients may improve spontaneously.

#### Immunoreactive inhibin levels during ovarian stimulation may predict granulosa cell maturity.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim of the study was to assess whether the immunoreactive inhibin response to ovarian stimulation in polycystic ovarian syndrome was of predictive value for the outcome of ovulation induction.
METHODS    				Daily injections of purified FSH (Metrodin, Serono Laboratories, UK) were administered for the purpose of inducing development and ovulation of a single follicle.
METHODS    				All patients had anovulatory infertility secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome and were resistant to clomiphene citrate.
METHODS    				Alternate day serum samples were obtained for measurement of gonadotrophins, sex steroids and inhibin by radioimmunoassay.
METHODS    				Alternate day ovarian ultrasound scans were carried out to monitor follicular development.
RESULTS    				There was a high incidence of multiple follicular development (MFD) (10.2 +/- 7.1 (standard deviation) follicles).
RESULTS    				There was a close relationship between the number of follicles on the day of the ovulatory trigger and serum oestradiol (E2) levels (R = 0.97, P < 0.001).
RESULTS    				This relationship was not seen with serum immunoreactive inhibin levels (R = 0.31).
RESULTS    				The cycles were divided into two groups depending whether there was or was not MFD (more than five follicles > 7 mm in diameter on day of hCG administration).
RESULTS    				The MFD group had 15.6 +/- 8.5 follicles and the non-MFD group 3.2 +/- 1.6 follicles.
RESULTS    				There was no difference in the circulating E2 concentration (pmol/l) per follicle between the two groups (non-MFD cycles, n = 6,345 +/- 28.9; MFD cycles, n = 8, 308 +/- 40.29).
RESULTS    				However, the immunoreactive inhibin concentration (U/ml) per follicle was lower, P < 0.001, in the MFD group (4.3 +/- 1.6 vs 6.9 +/- 0.5).
RESULTS    				The maximum and mean follicle diameter were lower, P < 0.01, in the MFD group (maximum follicle size 16.5 +/- 3.9 vs 21.2 +/- 1.5 mm, mean follicle size 11.5 +/- 2 vs 14.9 +/- 2.3).
RESULTS    				When individual cycles were examined E2 and immunoreactive inhibin secretion rose in parallel in cycles with less than five follicles with a rapid rise occurring when the follicles reached about 12 mm in diameter.
RESULTS    				In cycles where there was MFD there was a disparity between E2 and immunoreactive inhibin secretion with E2 levels rising 4.3 +/- 1.4 days before immunoreactive inhibin levels.
CONCLUSIONS				These data suggest that in cycles where there are multiple small follicles, E2 secretion is maintained whereas immunoreactive inhibin secretion is substantially lower.
CONCLUSIONS				Thus, in view of the disparity between E2 and immunoreactive inhibin secretion evident in the MFD group, measurement of immunoreactive serum inhibin concentration may be a better indicator of granulosa cell maturity.
CONCLUSIONS				Immunoreactive inhibin secretion may occur only from healthy mature follicles.

#### Human chorionic gonadotrophin contributes to the bioactivity of Pergonal.

OBJECTIVE  				We examined batch variation in the LH-like bioactive content of Pergonal and determined whether hCG contributes to this.
METHODS    				Random selection of three batches of Pergonal, consisting of three ampoules in each batch.
METHODS    				The LH content in each ampoule was determined by radioimmunoassay (R-LH), immunoradiometric assay (I-LH) and in vitro Leydig cell bioassay (B-LH) using the urinary hMG International Standard 70/45.
METHODS    				Human chorionic gonadotrophin was determined by immunoradiometric assay (I-hCG) using the hCG IRP 75/537.
METHODS    				The isohormone content of each batch was examined by chromatofocussing over the range pH 4.5-7.0 and the fractions collected were assayed for LH and hCG content.
METHODS    				The variability in potency between batches was assessed by single factor analysis of variance.
RESULTS    				The gonadotrophin content of each batch (IU/ampoule, mean +/- SEM, n = 3 ampoules) was R-LH (40.9 +/- 0.5, 40.8 +/- 0.2, 39.3 +/- 0.7, P > 0.15), I-LH (39.0 +/- 1.5, 28.3 +/- 0.8, 36.9 +/- 3.3, P < 0.001), B-LH (27.3 +/- 0.3, 12.0 +/- 0.9, 19.3 +/- 0.9, P < 0.001) and I-hCG (16.4 +/- 0.7, 11.7 +/- 0.2, 10.5 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001).
RESULTS    				The chromatofocussing recoveries below pH 5.5 expressed as a percentage of the total amount of analyte eluted from the column and collated for all three batches of Pergonal were (mean % +/- SD, n = 3 batches) R-LH (58.4 +/- 4.0), I-LH (41.3 +/- 7.5), B-LH (81.4 +/- 2.8) and I-hCG (87.8 +/- 3.7).
CONCLUSIONS				There was significant batch variation in the I-LH, B-LH and I-hCG (P < 0.001) but not the R-LH (P > 0.15) content of Pergonal.
CONCLUSIONS				More than 80% of the total B-LH recovery chromatofocussed below pH 5.5 and corresponded to the region of highest I-hCG (> 87%) and lowest I-LH (< 42%) recovery.
CONCLUSIONS				This was highly suggestive of hCG contributing to the LH-like bioactivity of Pergonal.

#### [Influenza A infection in children. Clinical spectrum and comparison with respiratory syncytial virus infection during the winter 1989-1990].

BACKGROUND 				Respiratory syncytial viral (RSV) infection can be rapidly differentiated from influenza viral infection by immunofluorescence techniques.
BACKGROUND 				These tests were used to identify some epidemiological and clinical characteristics of both infections.
METHODS    				77 RSV and 22 influenza viral infections were detected during an outbreak (November 1989 to March 1990) in 210 children less than 6 years admitted for lower respiration tract infections.
METHODS    				The fluorescent antibody assay was performed on nasal aspirates.
RESULTS    				The RSV outbreak ran from November to March, while the influenza outbreak was shorter, during December and January.
RESULTS    				The patients infected with RSV were younger (mean age: 6.7 months) than those infected with influenza virus (mean age: 20.9 months) (p < 0.001).
RESULTS    				Those with influenza virus infection presented with higher temperatures, more often had initial seizures (p < 0.05) and displayed fewer clinical or X-ray respiratory symptoms (p < 0.001).
RESULTS    				Mean durations of hospitalization were 9.9 days for RSV infection and 7.7 days for influenza virus infection.
RESULTS    				The therapeutic use of bronchial dilators, oxygen and steroids was correlated with the degree and duration of respiratory manifestations.
RESULTS    				A 3 month follow-up was insufficient to show any difference between recurrences or complications in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS				The clinical and radiological differences in these two groups of patients viral-infected are similar to those described in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS				Variability from one outbreak to another precludes any extrapolation to other populations and justifies the systematic use of the fluorescent antibody assay, especially when a specific antiviral therapy is considered.

#### [Phenotypic expression of 12 mutations of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene].

BACKGROUND 				Several mutations in the human phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene have been described and it may be interesting to tentatively correlate mutant genotypes and clinical phenotypes of phenylketonuria (PKU).
METHODS    				Twelve mutations were searched for using classical techniques of molecular biology in a total of 126 patients.
METHODS    				3 phenotypes were arbitrarily defined: typical PKU, atypical PKU or Mediterranean form, and persistent mild hyperphenylalaninemia.
METHODS    				The patients were classified according to the residual in vivo PAH activity.
RESULTS    				Mutations were found in 64 patients.
RESULTS    				One mutation was found in each of the 2 alleles in 20 children.
RESULTS    				Only one mutation could be identified in the other 44.
RESULTS    				Only 45 children could be assigned to a phenotype.
RESULTS    				Mutations leading to total loss of PAH activity were associated with typical PKU (in homozygotes or compound heterozygotes).
RESULTS    				Mutations leading to residual PAH activity were associated in homozygotes with atypical PKU; they were also associated in compounded heterozygotes with atypical PKU, irrespective of the fact that the other allele suppressed enzyme activity or was unknown.
RESULTS    				A mutation which changed the affinity of PAH for phenylalanine was associated with mild hyperphenylalaninemia.
CONCLUSIONS				The clinical heterogeneity of PKU can be correlated with identified mutations of the human PAH gene.
CONCLUSIONS				Molecular studies do not help to predict either the phenotype or the long-term outcome.
CONCLUSIONS				However, description of the biochemical changes combined with identification of the mutation should lead to a better understanding of consequences of mutation for PAH activity.

#### [Risk factors of sudden infant death and of death by accidents. According to a national survey in the total postneonatal death].

BACKGROUND 				The incidence of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) peaks at 2-4 month of age and during the colder months of the year.
BACKGROUND 				Other risk factors such as sex, birth weight, maternal age and multiple pregnancy also seem to be shared by the other causes of death after the neonatal period.
METHODS    				A retrospective, exhaustive survey of all deaths of infants aged 28 days-one year was carried out between September 1986 to December 1987.
METHODS    				The control group was a representative sample of the live births in France during 1989.
METHODS    				The deaths were classified into 3 groups: group I, 1184 SIDS, group II 228 SIDS remaining unexplained after autopsy (out of 315 autopsied SIDS), and group III 83 accidental deaths.
METHODS    				The factors studied were: sex, birth weight, maternal age, number of infants born from the pregnancy.
METHODS    				The risk factors were measured by Odds Ratios and the variables related to mortality were introduced into a logistic model.
RESULTS    				Incidence of deaths peaked between the 2nd and the 4th month of age in groups I and II while deaths were evenly distributed throughout the first year in group III.
RESULTS    				Colder months, male gender, low birthweight, multiple birth and the young age of the mother all increased the risk of death in SIDS (groups I and II) but the same factors were also linked to accidental deaths.
CONCLUSIONS				The results confirm those of earlier reports and raise the question why the risk factors for accidental deaths are similar to those for explained or unexplained SIDS, except for infant age.

#### [Evaluation of vaccine coverage in children under two years of age in Kinshasa (Zaire)].

BACKGROUND 				Despite efforts to make immunization against preventable diseases available to all children in Zaire, only about 33% of the children living at Kinshasa were immunized in 1986.
METHODS    				The compliance with the vaccination schedules was evaluated in 211 children less than 2 years of age consulting in the largest medical center of Kinshasa during one week in September 1989.
METHODS    				Socio-demographic data on the parents and histories of infectious preventable diseases in children were also collected.
RESULTS    				93% of the children were immunized against tuberculosis, 85% against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis, 76% against measles.
RESULTS    				Compliance with the vaccination schedule was higher when the mothers were better educated, or when they worked in the public service.
RESULTS    				25% of the children had not been immunized against measles at the age of 9 months.
CONCLUSIONS				The vaccine schedule and the strategy must still be improved.

#### Acute effect of rapid ventricular pacing and volume loading on total vascular capacitance.

OBJECTIVE  				Rapid right ventricular pacing (RRVP) at 250 beats/min plus a saline volume load produces acute heart failure manifested by a limited increase in cardiac output in response to the volume load and increased right atrial, pulmonary artery and capillary wedge pressures.
OBJECTIVE  				The effects on vascular capacitance are unknown.
METHODS    				Three groups of six anesthetized splenectomized dogs were subjected to RRVP alone at 250 beats/min for 40 mins volume loading alone with intravenous 0.9% sodium chloride 40 mL/kg over 10 mins or volume loading followed by RRVP for 15 mins.
METHODS    				Vascular capacitance, unstressed volume and compliance were determined from pressure-volume curves using transient circulatory arrests induced by acetylcholine before and 40 mins after starting the interventions.
RESULTS    				Neither RRVP nor volume loading alone produced acute heart failure or altered total vascular compliance.
RESULTS    				Fifteen minutes of RRVP after the volume load induced heart failure, reduced compliance (3.4 +/- 0.5 to 2.5 +/- 0.3 mL/mmHg/kg, P < 0.05), increased central blood volume (7.7 +/- 0.7 to 10.6 +/- 0.5 mL/kg, P < 0.01) and reduced the unstressed vascular volume to 57 +/- 10 mL/kg, compared with 77 +/- 9 mL/kg (P < 0.01) after the volume load alone.
RESULTS    				Stressed blood volume was increased similarly with either volume loading alone (20.1 +/- 2.0 to 30.0 +/- 1.7 mL/kg, P < 0.01) or volume loading plus RRVP (23.5 +/- 3.8 to 30.2 +/- 4.9 mL/kg, P < 0.01).
RESULTS    				The reduction in unstressed volume rather than an increase in stressed volume was the major peripheral change associated with acute heart failure induced by volume loading plus RRVP.
CONCLUSIONS				RRVP reduced vascular capacitance by a reduction in unstressed volume.
CONCLUSIONS				Acute volume loading of this smaller vascular compartment resulted in redistribution centrally and acute heart failure.

#### Effects of exogenous oxygen derived free radicals on myocardial capillary permeability, vascular tone, and incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in the canine heart.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to examine the effects of exogenous oxygen derived free radicals on myocardial capillary permeability for a small hydrophilic indicator, postischaemic vascular tone, and the occurrence of arrhythmias in the canine heart in vivo.
METHODS    				Free radicals were generated by simultaneous intracoronary infusion of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase into normally perfused myocardium, and at reperfusion following five minutes of coronary occlusion, respectively, in 20 anaesthetised open chest dogs.
METHODS    				Myocardial capillary extraction for 99mTc-DTPA, plasma flow rate, and the interstitial washout rate constant were measured by the single injection, residue detection method, and the capillary permeability-surface area product (PS) was calculated.
METHODS    				The maximum plasma flow during reactive hyperaemia was measured by the local 133Xe washout method.
RESULTS    				Hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase infusion into normally perfused myocardium induced a 15% decrease in capillary extraction (p = 0.05), a 24% decrease in PS (p < 0.01), and a 23% decrease in the interstitial washout rate constant (NS) two minutes after the end of the infusion.
RESULTS    				When hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase were infused into postischaemic myocardium, 86% of animals developed sustained ventricular arrhythmias, in contrast to none in control experiments (p < 0.05).
RESULTS    				The maximum plasma flow was 363% of preocclusive values in control experiments v 268% in hypoxanthine + xanthine oxidase experiments (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS				In normally perfused hearts, intracoronary infusion of hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase induce a decreased capillary extraction, suggesting a reduced capillary surface area.
CONCLUSIONS				In postischaemic myocardium these substances cause a decreased vasodilatation in the initial phase of reactive hyperaemia, and induce ventricular arrhythmias.

#### Intimal proliferation in an organ culture of human internal mammary artery.

OBJECTIVE  				Intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation is an early feature of atherosclerosis.
OBJECTIVE  				Its progression is difficult to monitor in humans and previous studies have mostly relied on necropsy material.
OBJECTIVE  				The aim of this study was therefore to establish whether intimal proliferation occurred in an organ culture of human internal mammary artery.
METHODS    				Segments of freshly isolated internal mammary artery were maintained din standard tissue culture medium containing 30% calf serum for 14 d. Tissue viability (measured by ATP concentration) was maintained during processing and throughout the culture period [211(SEM 28) nmol ATP.g-1 wet weight on d 1 v 208(27) on d 14].
RESULTS    				Histological transverse sections of cultured internal mammary artery showed the development of a neointima containing smooth muscle cells identified by immunocytochemistry for alpha actin.
RESULTS    				Pulse labelling of cultures with [3H]-thymidine showed proliferating cells predominantly in a neointimal layer with few dividing cells in the media.
RESULTS    				Cultured de-endothelialized vessels showed less neointimal thickening than cultured freshly isolated vessels [16(3) v 36(5) microns, p < 0.0025] as well as a reduced number of dividing cells per mm of neointimal length [3.1(0.6) v 5.5(1.1), p < 0.05].
CONCLUSIONS				Intimal proliferation occurred in organ culture of internal mammary artery.
CONCLUSIONS				There is evidence for a factor derived from the endothelium, which may be important in the development of intimal proliferation.

#### Ischaemic preconditioning is not dependent on neutrophils or glycolytic substrate at reperfusion in rabbit heart.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to determine whether reperfusion with either neutrophil free reperfusate or perfusate containing only pyruvate as the metabolic substrate would alter the protection against infarction afforded by preconditioning.
METHODS    				Rabbit hearts (n = 4-14 per group) underwent 30 minutes of regional ischaemia followed by 120 minutes of reperfusion.
METHODS    				Blood reperfused groups experienced both ischaemia and reperfusion in situ while Krebs reperfused groups experienced regional ischaemia in situ but were reperfused with Krebs buffer in vitro.
METHODS    				In another group, glucose in Krebs buffer was replaced by pyruvate.
RESULTS    				Preconditioning with 5 minutes regional ischaemia caused smaller infarct size in the blood reperfused hearts: 43.0(SEM 5.4)% v 8.8(4.2)%.
RESULTS    				In Krebs reperfused hearts, preconditioning caused a similar reduction of infarct size [49.9(2.5)% v 22.9(4.3)%] which was not different from that seen in the blood reperfused hearts.
RESULTS    				Replacing the glucose in the Krebs buffer by pyruvate also had no effect on infarct size in either the control or the preconditioned hearts [40.9(6.1)% v 11.8(5.2)%].
RESULTS    				Histology of the ischaemic zones revealed 59.6(15.0) neutrophils per 10 high power fields in hearts reperfused in situ but only 2.6(0.6) in Krebs reperfused hearts, equal to the numbers in nonischemic blood perfused myocardium [2.8(0.9)].
CONCLUSIONS				The mechanism of preconditioning is not due to attenuation of neutrophil function during reperfusion.
CONCLUSIONS				Furthermore, substituting pyruvate for glucose in the reperfusate did not prevent the protection against infarction afforded by ischaemic preconditioning.

#### Decreased aortic compliance aggravates subendocardial ischaemia in dogs with stenosed coronary artery.

OBJECTIVE  				The existence of decreased aortic compliance due to arteriosclerosis has been documented in patients with coronary artery disease.
OBJECTIVE  				The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of decreased aortic compliance on coronary artery disease.
METHODS    				To simulate coronary artery disease, a fixed stenosis was made in the left circumflex coronary artery in dogs.
METHODS    				Ten anaesthetised open chest dogs were used.
METHODS    				Aortic compliance was decreased by banding the thoracic aorta with adjustable plastic rings.
METHODS    				The level of coronary stenosis was adjusted to reduce the baseline flow by no more than 10% but enough to eliminate reactive hyperaemia induced by a 10 s occlusion.
METHODS    				Measurements of haemodynamics, regional myocardial segment length, subendocardial ECG, and myocardial tissue PO2 were performed at five stages (initial control stage, rest and pacing stages without aortic banding, and rest and pacing stages with the aortic banding).
RESULTS    				Haemodynamic variables were not changed at any stage, except for increased pulse pressure secondary to the aortic banding.
RESULTS    				During pacing with aortic banding, subendocardial PO2 (Endo) levels were decreased, and subepicardial PO2 (Epi) levels were increased, compared to those without the aortic banding [Endo: 43.2(SD 9.8) v 36.8(10.0) mm Hg, p < 0.05; Epi: 34.0(11.5) v 44.4(7.9) mm Hg, p < 0.05].
RESULTS    				ST elevation on the subendocardial ECG was greater, and myocardial segment shortening was less with the aortic bandage during pacing.
CONCLUSIONS				When the work of the heart is increased, a decrease in aortic compliance tends to compromise ischaemic myocardium further in the presence of an induced stenosis of a major coronary artery.

#### Atrial contractility affects phasic blood flow velocity of atrial small vessels in the dog.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to evaluate the relative contribution of atrial muscle contraction and atrial pressure to the phasic patterns of left atrial arterial and venous flows.
METHODS    				Using a laser Doppler velocimeter, blood velocities were measured in the atrial small arteries and veins (outer diameter: 150-500 microns) in anaesthetised open chest dogs (n = 21).
METHODS    				The velocity sensor was fixed on the vessel surface with a drop of cyanoacrylate glue when good quality Doppler signals were consistently observed.
METHODS    				Left atrial pressure and the contractility of the left atrium were changed by premature ventricular contraction and by intracoronary injection of isoprenaline (0.5 microgram), respectively.
RESULTS    				Premature ventricular contraction increased left atrial pressure significantly during arterial velocity measurements from 8.1(SD 2.7) to 16.4(1.3) mm Hg and during venous measurements from 8.2(1.2) to 14.3(3.7) mm Hg.
RESULTS    				However, premature ventricular contraction did not change the blood velocity patterns, the maximum deceleration rate of the systolic velocity wave in arteries, or the maximum acceleration rate of the systolic velocity wave in veins.
RESULTS    				Although isoprenaline did not change the left atrial pressure, it decreased minimum arterial blood velocity during atrial systole, from 3.3(3.4) to -2.5(3.2) cm.s-1, and increased maximum venous blood velocity from 15.9(5.5) to 19.2(7.4) cm.s-1.
RESULTS    				Isoprenaline also increased both the maximum arterial systolic velocity deceleration rate, from 90(45) to 234(143) cm.s-2, and the maximum venous systolic velocity acceleration rate from 356(230) to 763(366) cm.s-2.
CONCLUSIONS				(1) Left atrial pressure is not a major determinant of the blood flow patterns of the atrial arteries and veins, and therefore it may not closely reflect pressure around mural vessels. (
CONCLUSIONS				2) Atrial contractility affects the blood flow patterns of the atrial arteries and veins.

#### Higher erythropoietin secretion in response to cobaltous chloride in post-hypoxic than in hypertransfused polycythemic mice.

BACKGROUND 				We have shown previously that both erythrocyte production rate (EPR) and plasma erythropoietin (EPO) levels in response to hypoxia or to compounds able to stimulate EPO secretion are very much higher in post-hypoxic (PH) than in hypertransfused (HT) polycythemic mice with similar levels of hematocrit.
BACKGROUND 				Since it has been demonstrated that cobalt (Co) treatment rises renal EPO-mRNA and increases plasma EPO levels, the present study was conducted to determine whether there is a difference between PH and HT mice in relation to the erythropoietic response to Co and whether the stimulatory effect of Co on EPO secretion can be blunted by polycythemia.
METHODS    				Adult female mice of the CF-1 strain were made polycythemic by either exposing them to 270 h of discontinuous hypoxia (18 h/d) in a hypobaric chamber maintained at 456 hPA (PH mice) or by injecting them with 0.8 ml of washed packed red cells on two consecutive days (HT mice).
METHODS    				Measurement of the erythrocyte production rate (EPR) was made by RBC-59Fe uptake.
METHODS    				Plasma EPO concentration was determined by RIA.
METHODS    				Cobalt chloride (CoC12) was dissolved in saline and injected in doses of 4 and 8 umoles/mouse.
METHODS    				Recombinant human EPO (HEMAX 4000, Bio Sidus SA, Argentina) was dissolved in PBS + albumin to the desired concentration.
RESULTS    				By comparison with the corresponding dose-regression line for rHu-EPO, it was estimated that the responses (EPR) (measured as RBC-59Fe incorporation) of PH mice to sc injections of 4 and 8 umoles of CoC12 were equivalent to 95 and 145 mU of rHu-EPO, respectively.
RESULTS    				The response of HT mice to 4 umoles of the drug was not detectable.
RESULTS    				At the upper dose level, the response was equivalent to 52 mU of rHuEPO.
RESULTS    				Plasma immunoreactive EPO (iEPO) titers 12 h after COC12 (8 umoles) were not significantly different between normocythemic and PH mice.
RESULTS    				The observed values were significantly higher than those found in HT mice.
CONCLUSIONS				These findings demonstrate that EPO production in response to COC12 is depressed by polycythemia when induced by transfusion but not when induced by chronic exposure to hypobaric hypoxia.
CONCLUSIONS				They also confirm, but not explain the nature of the conditioning effect of exposure to hypoxia which makes the mechanism controlling EPO secretion either more sensitive to EPO-secreting stimuli or unable to recognize the polycythemic state.

#### Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) due to loss of anion exchange transporter.

BACKGROUND 				Hereditary spherocytosis encompasses a heterogenous group of inherited disorders due to alteration of r.b.c.
BACKGROUND 				surface/volume ratio.
BACKGROUND 				Spectrin deficiency is the most common observed defect.
BACKGROUND 				We analyzed a case of HS associated with band 3 deficiency without spectrin reduction.
METHODS    				In the study of a family originating from southern Italy, we show that a 20% deficiency of band 3 with normal spectrin content may be responsible for dominantly inherited hereditary spherocytosis (HS).
METHODS    				The proband is a 12 years old girl consulting for jaundice, chronic anaemia and splenomegaly.
METHODS    				Her mother had a similar haematologic phenotype.
RESULTS    				Electrophoretic analysis of erythrocyte membrane proteins showed a deficiency in band 3 protein.
RESULTS    				Band 3 protein chymotryptic fragments, deglycosylated band 3, and its isolated cytoplasmic domain, all displayed normal electrophoretic migrations.
RESULTS    				Furthermore, the tryptic peptides profile of the cytoplasmic domain of the protein did not demonstrate any abnormality, nor did the amino acid composition of the peptides.
RESULTS    				Analysis of the membrane proteins during erythrocyte ageing, evaluated in density-fractionated red cells, showed that band 3 content was normal in the lighter fraction, whereas in the denser fraction band 3 deficiency was more pronounced than in membranes from non fractionated red blood cells.
CONCLUSIONS				This case describes HS due to anion exchange transporter deficiency.
CONCLUSIONS				Our results on fractioned red cells support the hypothesis that the defect was probably due to a band 3 protein loss during cell ageing and not to a primitive quantitative defect.

#### High-dose cyclophosphamide followed by GM-CSF is a safe and effective procedure for the recruitment of trilineage circulating progenitor cells.

BACKGROUND 				Several methods for the recruitment of circulating progenitor cells (CPC) to be used for hemopoietic rescue after myeloablative therapy have been described.
BACKGROUND 				The present study was designed to verify the effectiveness and safeness of one of such procedures, involving the administration of high-dose cyclophosphamide (HD-CTX) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
METHODS    				Eight tumor patients were treated with HD-CTX (7 g/m2), followed by GM-CSF (7 mcg/Kg/day, continuous infusion) from day +2 to the completion of leukocyte recovery, when aphereses for CPC harvesting were performed.
METHODS    				CPC were evaluated by clonogenic assay for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) and erythrocyte burst-forming units (BFU-E) before therapy as well as during the hemopoietic recovery.
RESULTS    				In each patient, a significant increase of trilineage CPC was observed, at a mean of 14 days from HD-CTX, with peak increment of 224, 268 and 230-fold for CFU-GM, CFU-Meg and BFU-E respectively.
RESULTS    				The mean duration of leukocyte count < or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 6.6 days, with severe thrombocytopenia (grade 4 WHO) lasting 2.8 days in 5 patients.
RESULTS    				GM-CSF infusion was well tolerated without any need for dose reduction or discontinuation.
CONCLUSIONS				The administration of HD-CTX and GM-CSF induces a significant enhancement of CPC including CFU-Meg other than CFU-GM and BFU-E. The procedure is suitable for the recruitment of CPC in patients with CTX sensitive tumors.

#### Limiting dilution analysis of IL-2 producing cells: I. Studies of normal human peripheral blood.

BACKGROUND 				After marrow transplantation, the interaction of helper T lymphocytes from the donor with the patient alloantigens leads to cellular activation and release of IL-2 as initial events of the graft versus host reaction.
BACKGROUND 				A method for assessing the size of the pool containing allospecific helper T cells capable of producing IL-2 could be applied in the selection of better donors for marrow transplantation.
METHODS    				PBMC are added to replicate sets of wells each containing various amounts of EBV-LCL cells and PHA.
METHODS    				After culture for some days the supernatant is removed from each well and added to IL-2 dependent CTLL-2 line.
METHODS    				The proliferation of the CTLL-2 line is assessed by pulse labeling with 3H-thimidine.
METHODS    				The precursor frequency of cell capable of producing IL-2 per ml/blood is estimated from the minimum X2 regression of the function of non-responding wells plotted as logarithmic function of the number of PBMC added per well.
RESULTS    				Approximately 30-40% of PBMC are found to produce IL-2 under the following conditions in culture: the optimal PHA concentration is 1.25 micrograms/ml, the optimal number of stimulator EBV-LCL cells is 1 x 10(3) and 3 days of culture are required.
CONCLUSIONS				Here we report a rapid and quantitative technique of limiting dilution analysis that can estimate the frequency of peripheral blood mononuclear cells capable of secreting interleukin-2 following interaction with specific alloantigen.

#### A pilot External Quality Assessment Scheme for haemocytometry in Italy.

BACKGROUND 				An Italian EQA scheme for haemocytometry, organized by the Istituto Superiore di Sanità, has been active for about five years (1984-1989).
BACKGROUND 				The aims of this programme were to evaluate the state of the art and to introduce in Italy a scheme recommended by ICSH.
BACKGROUND 				N. 126 public laboratories from different provinces joined voluntarily the programme and trials for haemoglobinometry (A01, A02), full blood count (B01-B08) and platelet count (D01-D03) were performed.
METHODS    				Materials for testing consisted of blood lysate, preserved blood preparation containing native red cells and pseudoleukocytes, suspension of fixed platelets.
METHODS    				The performances of laboratories was evaluated by consensus values (median, mean and standard deviation) and individual deviation index.
RESULTS    				The instrument survey demonstrated that fully automated systems had the highest frequency.
RESULTS    				Non Gaussian distributions of results were often obtained and this was particularly true for WBC, PLT and MCV.
RESULTS    				The overall variability was lower than 5.5% for Hb, RBC and MCH and lower than 9.3% for other erythrocyte parameters; WBC and PLT counts displayed a higher dispersion (CV* = 9.8% and 25.4%); the spreading of results was strongly reduced in the homogeneous group of Coulter counters.
RESULTS    				In the course of the programme CV*s didn't show any relevant modification, a steady state performance being apparent.
RESULTS    				As regards the nature of variability, the random component was prevalent for all parameters, with the exception of MCV.
CONCLUSIONS				This pilot programme allowed to demonstrate the practicability of a national EQAS for haemocytometry according to the ICSH guidelines.
CONCLUSIONS				Materials for testing showed acceptable stability, homogeneity and commutability.
CONCLUSIONS				As regards analytical equipment as well as analytical variability, hospital centers participating in these EQA trials were comparable with laboratories taking part in similar EQAS of other European countries.

#### Evaluation of erythroid marrow response to recombinant human erythropoietin in patients with cancer anaemia.

BACKGROUND 				Anaemia is a frequent finding in patients with cancer and may be due to different causes, including blunted erythropoietin production.
METHODS    				In a pilot study, we administered recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) to twelve patients with solid tumours and secondary anaemia.
METHODS    				rHuEPO was given subcutaneously 5 d per week at escalating doses (75 to 150 U/kg per day): the aim of treatment was a Hb level > or = 10 g/dl without blood transfusion.
METHODS    				We evaluated endogenous EPO production through serum EPO levels and erythroid marrow activity by means of serum transferrin receptor (TfR).
RESULTS    				Six out of 12 subjects had defective endogenous EPO production.
RESULTS    				All patients but two responded to treatment with steady increases in Hb levels above 10 g/dl, and the median dose of rHuEPO required for correction of anaemia was 75 U/kg.
RESULTS    				Response was associated with an early increase in serum TfR. Six patients developed functional iron deficiency and required iron supplementation to obtain response.
RESULTS    				Treatment improved functional ability in 4/10 responders.
CONCLUSIONS				Subcutaneous rHuEPO can stimulate erythroid marrow activity in cancer anaemia, even in patients with advanced disease, and marrow response can be adequately monitored by serum TfR. Functional iron deficiency as a cause of nonresponse to rHuEPO is frequent in these patients and may require parenteral iron administration.
CONCLUSIONS				Although erythropoietin can improve the anaemia of cancer, the decision to treat should be individualised for each patient, looking more at the quality of life and cost-effectiveness than at cosmetic increases in the haemoglobin level.

#### alpha-Interferon treatment of chronic hepatitis C in young patients with homozygous beta-thalassemia.

BACKGROUND 				Chronic infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and iron overload are the main causes of chronic liver disease in subjects with homozygous beta-thalassemia (HBT).
BACKGROUND 				Iron overload can be counteracted by intensive chelation.
BACKGROUND 				alpha-interferon reduces viremia and necroinflammation in patients with chronic HCV hepatitis.
METHODS    				To assess the effectiveness and safety of alpha 2b-Interferon (IFN), we enrolled in an open pilot trial of treatment 12 patients with HBT and biopsy-proven anti-HCV positive chronic hepatitis.
METHODS    				IFN was given at a dose of 5 MU/m2 thrice weekly for 8 weeks, then 3 MU/m2 thrice weekly for 18 weeks.
METHODS    				Patients were followed up to 24 months after stopping treatment when a second liver biopsy was performed in subjects with sustained response (normal ALT during follow-up).
RESULTS    				Two patients discontinued IFN at 7 weeks because of haemolytic anemia and one after 8 weeks due to persistent fever.
RESULTS    				Among 9 subjects completing the protocol, 5 normalized ALT while on treatment and a further 2 within two months after stopping IFN.
RESULTS    				A sustained response was obtained altogether in 5 patients, since ALT relapsed in 2 responders.
RESULTS    				None of the 3 subjects who discontinued IFN and of the 2 patients who did not respond to treatment normalized ALT over a 24 months follow-up.
RESULTS    				Post-treatment liver histology in long-term responders showed a reduction of portal, periportal and lobular necroinflammation, while siderosis was essentially unchanged.
CONCLUSIONS				Although the pattern of response to IFN in HCV-infected subjects with HBT might differ from that of non-thalassemics, due to peculiar side effects and delayed response, the drug appears to be effective and deserves further investigation.

#### Cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption in patients with COPD on mechanical ventilation.

OBJECTIVE  				To investigate the effect of PaCO2 on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
METHODS    				Before-after trial.
METHODS    				General ICU in a regional hospital.
METHODS    				7 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation because of an exacerbation of COPD.
METHODS    				CBF and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) of COPD were measured before and after hyperventilation and were compared by those of normal patients.
METHODS    				CBF was measured by the Kety-Schmidt technique using 15% N2O.
RESULTS    				Hyperventilation produced a significant reduction in CBF in COPD with no concomitant change in CMRO2.
RESULTS    				CMRO2 in COPD was significantly lower than those in normal patients.
RESULTS    				The regression equation was shifted significantly more to the right in COPD.
CONCLUSIONS				The sensitivity of CBF in CO2 remained but CMRO2 was reduced markedly in COPD patients.

#### Electron-microscopic description of accretions occurring on tips of infected and non-infected central venous catheters.

OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of the study was do describe the architecture of accretions occurring on the tips of central venous catheters (CVC).
METHODS    				A conservative procedure was used followed by two different techniques of electron microscopy.
METHODS    				the study included 19 catheters which have been used on intensive cared adults, and which were chosen among those of parallel 300 CVC study.
RESULTS    				CVC were considered sterile, contaminated, colonized or infected according to microbiological and clinical criteria.
RESULTS    				CVC were found to remain much cleaner than in past descriptions.
RESULTS    				When present, accretions were located on the olive-shaped end, and displayed stratified structures with three types of material: amorphous material, thrombus components and inflammatory cells.
RESULTS    				Bacteria were not seen, even on culture positive CVC.
RESULTS    				Candida albicans was found on one CVC in the cytoplasm of granulocytes, and made no direct contact with the plastic surface.
CONCLUSIONS				This technique should contribute to the understanding of the pathobiology of CVC infection and provide information proving or precluding the involvement of microbial adherence to polymers in vivo.

#### Possible risk for cardiac arrhythmia related to intravenous erythromycin.

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the incidence of prolongation of the rate-corrected electrocardiographic QT interval (QTc) and of ventricular arrhythmia associated with intravenous administration of erythromycin lactobionate.
METHODS    				A consecutive series of 7 critically ill patients treated with intravenous erythromycin for severe pneumonia.
METHODS    				A medical intensive care unit of a university hospital.
RESULTS    				Registration of QTc duration before and after intravenous administration of erythromycin as a short infusion.
RESULTS    				Blood chemistry, hemodynamic variables, arrhythmias, and co-medications were recorded.
RESULTS    				Evaluation of at least 10 ECG intervals by 2 experienced investigators who were blinded as to the time of drug administration.
RESULTS    				If several measurements were performed in the same patient, only the mean value was used for further analysis.
RESULTS    				During 12 of 13 drug administrations studied in 7 patients QTc prolongation was observed.
RESULTS    				The extent of QTc prolongation was significantly correlated with the infusion rate (mg/min, r = 0.765, p = 0.05).
RESULTS    				In 3 patients ventricular arrhythmia occurred in close temporal relation to the erythromycin infusion; two of them developed ventricular fibrillation shortly after the first and second dose of erythromycin, respectively, and died within 3 h.
CONCLUSIONS				In critically ill patients erythromycin-induced QTc prolongation is a frequent pharmacologic effect correlated with erythromycin infusion rate.
CONCLUSIONS				To avoid changes in electrocardiographic intervals and thereby possibly potentially life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia administration with the lowest possible infusion rate and close cardiac rhythm monitoring are advisable in these patients.

#### The influence of different levels of PEEP on peripheral tissue perfusion measured by subcutaneous and transcutaneous oxygen tension.

OBJECTIVE  				To compare subcutaneous (PscO2) and transcutaneous (PtcO2) oxygen tension measurements in relation to hemodynamic variables at different levels of PEEP, and to evaluate the usefulness of these measurements as monitors of peripheral tissue perfusion.
METHODS    				Prospective trial.
METHODS    				Intensive care unit in a university hospital.
METHODS    				Seven patients with gastric cancer who where undergoing total gastrectomy.
METHODS    				Silicone catheter was placed in the upper arm and transcutaneous oxygen monitor was placed on the upper part of the chest.
METHODS    				A pulmonary artery catheter was placed in the right pulmonary artery.
RESULTS    				PscO2 and PtcO2 together with hemodynamic variables were measured at different levels of PEEP.
RESULTS    				Progressive increase of PEEP reduced cardiac index (CI) (p < 0.05) with a concomitant decrease of PscO2 (p < 0.05) and oxygen delivery (DO2) (p < 0.05).
RESULTS    				Changes in PtcO2 paralleled changes in arterial oxygen tension (PaO2), but no correlation was found between PtcO2, CI and DO2.
CONCLUSIONS				PscO2 is a sensitive indicator of subcutaneous tissue perfusion, which can be used to identify the PEEP level, with optimum peripheral perfusion.
CONCLUSIONS				PscO2 seems to be a more reliable indicator of tissue perfusion than PtcO2.

#### Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium in hospitalized children.

OBJECTIVE  				Determine the epidemiology and risk factors for colonization with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
METHODS    				Survey; case-control study.
METHODS    				Children's hospital.
METHODS    				Pediatric oncology patients.
METHODS    				Contact isolation, restriction of vancomycin prescribing.
RESULTS    				There was a high prevalence of colonization with vancomycin-resistant enterococci among pediatric oncology patients.
RESULTS    				The length of hospitalization and the administration of vancomycin and other intravenous antibiotics was associated with colonization.
RESULTS    				Prevention of colonization was associated with restriction of vancomycin use and contact isolation.
CONCLUSIONS				Vancomycin use may predispose to colonization with vancomycin-resistant E faecium.
CONCLUSIONS				Vancomycin-resistant E faecium may be nosocomially spread.
CONCLUSIONS				Contact isolation and restriction of vancomycin use may prevent spread of vancomycin-resistant E faecium.

#### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a questionnaire survey of 75 long-term care facilities in western New York.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the frequency of recognition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as an infection control problem and its prevalence among long-term care facilities, and to evaluate whether certain long-term care facility characteristics such as bed size, ownership, level of infection control activity, and frequency of resident transfers to acute care hospitals are related to the recognition or prevalence of MRSA in this setting.
METHODS    				Questionnaire survey.
METHODS    				Seventy-five long-term care facilities in the 8 counties of western New York.
RESULTS    				Seventy-five of 81 (92.6%) long-term care facilities returned a completed questionnaire.
RESULTS    				Seventy-nine percent were considered to have a "limited" level of infection control activity (part-time infection control practitioner who spent less than 10 hours a week on infection control activities).
RESULTS    				The larger the long-term care facility, the more time was spent on infection control activities (p = .01).
RESULTS    				Seventy-two percent of the long-term care facilities screened new admissions for MRSA by reviewing culture reports; 69% of the long-term care facilities had a specific infection control policy for MRSA.
RESULTS    				Sixteen of the 75 (21%) facilities felt they had an infection control problem with MRSA.
RESULTS    				By univariate analysis, the only characteristic significantly associated with this recognition was use of nurse practitioners or physician assistants by a facility (p < .05).
RESULTS    				Eighty-one percent of the 75 long-term care facilities had identified one or more patients with MRSA in the year prior to the survey.
RESULTS    				By univariate analysis, the only characteristics that were significantly associated with the number of residents with MRSA were the monthly average number of residents transferred to acute care facilities (p = .034) and facility bed size (p = .022); there was also a trend toward increasing intensity of infection control activities (p = .085).
RESULTS    				However, facility bed size and the average number of resident transfers per month to acute care facilities were strongly associated (p = .0002).
RESULTS    				By stepwise logistic regression analysis, only bed size was an independent predictor of the number of residents with MRSA.
RESULTS    				Many long-term care facilities had tried to eradicate MRSA; ciprofloxacin was most commonly used to eradicate MRSA.
CONCLUSIONS				The vast majority of the 75 long-term care facilities in the 8 counties of western New York have identified patients with MRSA, although only a minority (21%) of them actually believed that an infection control problem existed.
CONCLUSIONS				Facility size (a surrogate for the monthly average number of resident transfers to acute care facilities) seems to be an important factor in determining the number of residents with MRSA in long-term care facilities in our geographic region.
CONCLUSIONS				The major longitudinal studies of MRSA in such facilities have so far been done only in Veterans Affairs facilities.
CONCLUSIONS				Further studies are needed in freestanding long-term care facilities, the largest group of long-term care facilities in the United States, to determine the epidemiology of MRSA in this setting and to develop practical and valid infection control methods for residents with MRSA.

#### Healthcare workers' risk of contact with body fluids in a hospital: the effect of complying with the universal precautions policy.

OBJECTIVE  				To test whether healthcare workers' knowledge of and compliance with the basic principle of the Universal Precautions policy (i.e., that all patients should be treated equally regarding contact with body fluids) influenced the rate of contact with patient blood.
METHODS    				Survey based on anonymous questionnaires.
METHODS    				A 380-bed secondary and tertiary care hospital receiving emergency and elective patients.
METHODS    				All employees having any contact with patients.
METHODS    				Nine hundred one of 1,308 (69%) of the questionnaires were returned.
RESULTS    				Twelve percent of the respondents (95% confidence interval [CI95] = 10.0%-14.4%) had experienced any contact with patient blood in the week preceding their answer.
RESULTS    				Physicians had the highest rate of contact with blood followed by nurses.
RESULTS    				In the five groups--physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians and phlebotomists, nursing aides, and student nurses--contact with blood was less frequent in the subgroup that did know and comply with the basic principle of the Universal Precautions policy, compared with the subgroup that did not.
RESULTS    				When adding the results for the 5 groups, contact with blood was experienced by 91 of 571 (15.9%, CI95 = 13%-19%) of the personnel who did not know and comply with Universal Precautions.
RESULTS    				The personnel who did know and comply with Universal Precautions had a significantly lower (9 of 111 [8.1%], p < .05, CI95 = 3.8%-15%) rate of contact with blood.
CONCLUSIONS				The healthcare workers who knew and complied with Universal Precautions had a significant lower rate of contact with patient blood than those who did not.

#### A controlled assessment of direct intraperitoneal insemination.

OBJECTIVE  				To test the efficacy of direct intraperitoneal (IP) insemination and its effect on cell-mediated immunity.
METHODS    				A prospective trial with each couple having one treatment (insemination) cycle and one control (timed intercourse) cycle performed in random order with the same ovulation stimulation in both cycles.
METHODS    				Secondary and tertiary referral fertility clinics; university teaching hospital.
METHODS    				Twenty-six infertile couples.
METHODS    				Excluding pregnancy, only one couple did not complete the two cycles.
METHODS    				Ovulation induction in both cycles.
METHODS    				Intraperitoneal insemination in the insemination cycles.
METHODS    				These were pregnancy rate (treatment versus control) and mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) sensitivity (before and after direct IP insemination treatment).
RESULTS    				There were four control and no treatment pregnancies.
RESULTS    				This was not a significant difference (odds ratio).
RESULTS    				Mixed lymphocyte responses in fertile subjects did not change during the menstrual cycle (Wilcoxon).
RESULTS    				There was no significant increase in MLR sensitivity to partner's cells after direct IP insemination treatment.
CONCLUSIONS				This controlled study found no benefit from direct IP insemination in terms of pregnancies over control cycles.
CONCLUSIONS				There was no evidence that direct IP insemination had increased cell-mediated immune response sensitivity to husband's cells.

#### Autoantibodies to nuclear lamin C in the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan ingestion.

OBJECTIVE  				To examine the autoantibodies (antinuclear antibodies [ANA]) present in serum from a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS).
METHODS    				Sera obtained during the early phase of EMS and following therapy with prednisone were screened by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells, and ANA were characterized by immunoblotting on a purified nuclear lamin fraction.
RESULTS    				ANA with a ring-like pattern of nuclear staining were identified at high titer by immunofluorescence, and immunoblotting experiments showed them to be directed against lamin C. The antibody titer declined dramatically after discontinuation of L-tryptophan and therapy with prednisone.
CONCLUSIONS				This is the first characterization of an antigen/autoantibody system associated with EMS.
CONCLUSIONS				The findings indicate that this EMS-associated autoantibody recognizes epitopes localized in the carboxyterminal region of lamin C. The occurrence of anti-lamin C autoantibodies in one EMS patient expands the spectrum of clinical conditions associated with these antibodies, and provides evidence for an autoimmune response in EMS.

#### The prognostic value of serum troponin T in unstable angina.

BACKGROUND 				Cardiac troponin T is a regulatory contractile protein not normally found in blood.
BACKGROUND 				Its detection in the circulation has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for myocardial cell damage.
BACKGROUND 				We used a newly developed enzyme immunoassay for troponin T to determine whether its presence in the serum of patients with unstable angina was a prognostic indicator.
METHODS    				We screened 109 patients with unstable angina (25 with accelerated or subacute angina and 84 with acute angina at rest) for serum creatine kinase activity, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB activity, and troponin T every eight hours for two days after admission to the hospital.
METHODS    				The outcomes of interest during the hospitalization were death and myocardial infarction.
RESULTS    				Troponin T was detected (range, 0.20 to 3.64 micrograms per liter; mean, 0.78; median, 0.50) in the serum of 33 of the 84 patients (39 percent) with acute angina at rest.
RESULTS    				Only three of these patients had elevated creatine kinase MB activity (two were positive for troponin T, and one was negative).
RESULTS    				Of the 33 patients who were positive for troponin T, 10 (30 percent) had myocardial infarction (3 after coronary-artery bypass surgery), and 5 of these died during hospitalization.
RESULTS    				In contrast, only 1 of the 51 patients with angina at rest who were negative for troponin T had an acute myocardial infarction (P less than 0.001), and this patient died (P = 0.03).
RESULTS    				Thus, 10 of the 11 patients with myocardial infarctions had detectable levels of troponin T; only 1 had elevated creatine kinase MB activity.
RESULTS    				Troponin T was not detected in any of the 25 patients with accelerated or subacute angina, and none of these patients died.
CONCLUSIONS				Cardiac troponin T in serum appears to be a more sensitive indicator of myocardial-cell injury than serum creatine kinase MB activity, and its detection in the circulation may be a useful prognostic indicator in patients with unstable angina.

#### Functional significance of premature ventricular complex morphology evaluated during treadmill exercise stress test in patients with coronary artery disease.

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the relation between premature ventricular complexes morphology and left ventricular myocardial systolic function in patients with proved coronary artery disease.
METHODS    				Department of Cardiology at General Hospital.
METHODS    				From 112 patients (pts) with proved coronary artery disease, thirty-three pts with premature ventricular complexes (PVC) detected during treadmill exercise stress test were selected.
METHODS    				Two groups of pts were considered: group I-20 pts with regular contour or with a narrow notching (< 40 ms; type I PVC) and group II-13 patients with wide notching (> 40 ms; type II PVC).
METHODS    				In each group the following parameters were studied: ejection fraction, QRS duration, duration of exercise, number of metabolic units and the prevalence of ventricular aneurysm and mitral regurgitation.
RESULTS    				Statistical significant differences were found between group I and II concerning the mean ejection fraction (59.2% vs 48.6%; p < 0.05).
RESULTS    				The prevalence of ventricular aneurysm and mitral regurgitation was higher in patients with type II ventricular premature complexes (10% vs 30%).
CONCLUSIONS				Particular characteristics of premature ventricular complexes detected during treadmill exercise stress test, in patients with proved coronary artery disease, suggest the presence of left ventricular myocardial systolic dysfunction.

#### [Occurrence of dynamic atrial spontaneous contrast in patients with mitral disease].

OBJECTIVE  				The aim of this study was to analyze, through transesophageal echocardiography, different factors related to left atrial spontaneous echocardiographic formation.
METHODS    				Transthoracic and transesophageal comparative study of left atrial thrombotic phenomena.
METHODS    				Ambulatory and in hospital patients referred to Gregorio Marañon General Hospital Echocardiographic Laboratory.
METHODS    				120 consecutive patients with mitral valve disease or prosthesis were included in this transesophageal echocardiographic prospective study.
METHODS    				All patients were divided in two groups, according with left atrial spontaneous contrast.
METHODS    				In each patient we measured total left atrial area, rhythm abnormalities, mitral valve area, left atrial cavity thrombus and maximal mitral regurgitation area.
RESULTS    				Transthoracic echocardiography did not detect any patient with left atrial spontaneous contrast, compared to 57.5% diagnosed through the transesophageal technique.
RESULTS    				Transesophageal echocardiography diagnosed left atrial thrombosis in 19% (n = 23) of patients compared to 1% (n = 2) through the transthoracic technique.
RESULTS    				In the group with left atrial contrast, 59% of patients had mitral regurgitation less than 600 mm2, 64% were in atrial fibrillation and left atrial total area was 28 +/- 10.8 mm2.
CONCLUSIONS				Transesophageal echocardiography is the technique of choice to diagnose, with greater security, left atrial cavity thrombosis, and establish the relationship of echocardiographic variables and left atrial thrombotic phenomena.
CONCLUSIONS				Among these echocardiographic factors, left atrial dynamic spontaneous echocontrast is fundamental.

#### [Pulse wave velocity as expression of arterial compliance and its importance in the evaluation of arterial hypertension].

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the arterial compliance through the evaluation of pulse wave velocity.
METHODS    				Open study with direct comparison of different groups within a 12 week evaluation period.
METHODS    				69 patients, 49 with hypertension and 20 normals individuals.
METHODS    				Different groups with the following treatments: Isradipine, Lisinopril, Dilevalol and no therapy.
RESULTS    				There is marked differences in the pulse wave velocity when hypertensive patients are compared with normal individuals (p < 0.001).
RESULTS    				In a 12 week therapeutic evaluation there is an improvement in the pulse wave velocity particularly when the arterial pressure was lowered to normal values in the hypertensive patients: Lisinopril (p < 0.005), Isradipine (p < 0.005), Dilevalol (p < 0.025).
CONCLUSIONS				It is very easy to evaluate the pulse wave velocity.
CONCLUSIONS				Arterial compliance, which may be evaluated using the pulse wave velocity, is significantly reduced in hypertensive patients, compared with age-matched control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS				The use of antihypertensive drugs is associated with changes in arterial compliance.
CONCLUSIONS				There is a significant decrease in the pulse wave velocity after the administration of ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers for an equivalent fall in blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS				These observations emphasizes the potential importance of the changes in the large arteries, considered as either an associated factor or a consequence of elevated blood pressure, in the evaluation of the cardiovascular morbidity, and mortality of patients treated for hypertension.

#### [Formation of left ventricular thrombus in acute myocardial infarction: significance of the determination of fibrinogen, of products of fibrinogen degradation, and of plasminogen].

OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the significance of the fibrinogen, the plasminogen and the fibrinogen degradation products levels as marks of left intraventricular thrombosis (LIVT) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
METHODS    				219 consecutive patients of AMI admitted in a Coronary Care Unit of an University Hospital, were prospectively studied.
METHODS    				All protocols included a clinical evaluation, an M-mode and 2D echocardiographic study and blood samples, at day 1, 3, 7 and at hospital discharge.
METHODS    				In the intraventricular thrombus evaluation just the 4 Asinger grade was considered.
METHODS    				In the laboratory evaluation we used: the Clauss chronometric method for the fibrinogen, the colorimetric method for the plasminogen and the agglutination in plaque for the FDP.
METHODS    				The patients with ECO in the 2 or 3 Asinger grades and those in which ECO and laboratory study were not performed in the same day, were excluded.
METHODS    				101 patients remained on the study, and they were divided in two groups: 53 patients with LIVT and 48 patients without it.
RESULTS    				In both groups the fibrinogen raised along the first six days of the AMI, however in the group with LIVT this level didn't raise as high as in the group without LIVT (p < 0.001).
RESULTS    				In the FDP evaluation two peaks were found, one at 48 hours and another on the 6 th day, but there were no differences between the two groups.
RESULTS    				The plasminogen values raised along the first week of AMI, in a similar way in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS				a) Fibrinogen levels raises in AMI, but this elevation is significantly smaller in the group with LIVT, which suggests fibrinogen consume in fibrin formation of the thrombus.
CONCLUSIONS				b) FDP and plasminogen levels raise along the first week of AMI, but in a similar way in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS				c) None of these parameters permitted to individualize patients with thrombus formation.

#### [Transthoracic and transesophageal comparative echocardiography in mitral valve prolapse].

OBJECTIVE  				Transthoracic and transesophageal comparative analysis of functional and morphological abnormalities associated to idiopathic mitral valve prolapse (MVP).
METHODS    				Prospective study.
METHODS    				Outpatients with MVP diagnosis referred to echocardiographic laboratory of Cardiology Institute in Madrid, Spain.
METHODS    				In each case we analyzed by TTE and TEE, anterior, posterior and double localization of MVP, number of prolapsed mitral leaflets/patient, total area of MVP to mitral valve plane, mitral annulus diameter, total area and spatial distribution of mitral regurgitation.
RESULTS    				TEE diagnosed a greater number of prolapsed mitral leaflets and a greater percentage of double (80%) MVP.
RESULTS    				MPV area by TEE (50 +/- 31 mm2) was considerably larger (96 +/- 30 mm2) than TTE MVP area (50 +/- 31 mm3.
RESULTS    				Associated mitral valve regurgitation area calculated through TEE was larger (558 +/- 502 mm2) than the same parameter evaluated by TTE (450 +/- 515 mm2).
CONCLUSIONS				TEE is an efficient technique in MVP non invasive diagnosis and particularly sensitive to posterior MVP.
CONCLUSIONS				Our data could be helpful in MVP cases scheduled for mitral valve repairment.

#### [Hypertensive reaction to exercise. Retrospective studies of 1363 consecutive exercise tests].

OBJECTIVE  				To study exercise hypertensive reaction and its relation with rest blood pressure, hypertension type and hypertensive cardiac disease.
METHODS    				Retrospective study of treadmill exercise testes (ET) performed from January/89 to June/91: (n: 1703).
METHODS    				Stress tests Laboratory of Cardiology Service of a Military Hospital.
METHODS    				1363 consecutive ET of male subjects, performing at least the 3rd stage of the Bruce protocol, were studied.
METHODS    				From each ET record were obtained general data, including the reason for test, medication and the rest and exercise blood pressure.
METHODS    				Exercise hypertensive reaction was defined as a Bruce protocol 3rd stage systolic blood pressure above 187 mmHg, which corresponds to mean +2SD of 130 normal male subjects previously studied.
METHODS    				The Echocardiograms of non-treated hypertensives, obtained less than a month from ET, were reviewed.
METHODS    				The diagnosis of borderline or moderate hypertension was base on the clinical records.
RESULTS    				1) The 1363 ET included 132 (9.7%) ET to study hypertensive subjects, and 68 of these had hypertensive reaction.
RESULTS    				86 ET were performed by non-treated hypertensive subjects, of whom 73 had Echocardiogram.
RESULTS    				43 (3.5%) from 1231 ET performed by non-hypertensive subjects also had exercise hypertensive reaction.
RESULTS    				2) The left ventricular (LV) mass index of non-treated hypertensive patients had a positive correlation with exercise systolic pressure (r: 0.45; p < 0.001), more important than with rest blood pressure or exercise systolic pressure response; there was a relation with LV wall thickness, but not with internal ventricular dimensions, that was only observed in hypertensive subjects that also had hypertensive reaction to exercise.
RESULTS    				3) Exercise systolic blood pressure was usually normal in borderline and elevated in moderate hypertensives (Qui2: 27.249; p < 0.001).
RESULTS    				4) Subjects with exercise hypertensive reaction, but not previously diagnosed as hypertensives, were usually true hypertensives.
CONCLUSIONS				1) Hypertensive peaks seem to be an important determinant factor in LV hypertrophy of hypertension, but its influence is felt only above a certain blood pressure threshold; it results on LV concentric type hypertrophy.
CONCLUSIONS				2) Exercise systolic blood pressure had a discrimination power of about 80% to separate borderline and moderate hypertensive subjects.
CONCLUSIONS				3) All subjects having an exercise hypertensive reaction must be carefully observed, even if their blood pressure at rest is normal, because most of them are true hypertensive patients.

#### [Infective endocarditis: analysis of 300 episodes].

OBJECTIVE  				Study of clinical features and etiologic agents, treatment and mortality of patients with infective endocarditis (IE).
METHODS    				300 episodes of IE occurring in 288 patients, ages ranged between 0.2 and 78 (mean 30.76) years; 185 (62%) episodes occurred in males.
RESULTS    				a) etiologic agents: viridans group streptococci in 93 (31%) episodes, enterococci en 21 (7%), group D-non enterococci in 19 (6%) (13 S. bovis), other streptococci in 14 (5%), Staphylococcus aureus in 59 (20%), Staphylococcus epidermidis in 14 (5%), gram-negative bacteria in 16 (5%), gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci and staphylococci and staphylococci in 8 (3%), fungi in 4 (1%).
RESULTS    				The etiologic agents were not identified in 52 (17%) episodes; b) underlying cardiac diseases: valvular heart disease in 119 (40%) episodes, congenital heart disease in 37 (12%), prosthetic heart valves in 69 (23%), other heart diseases in 6 (2%).
RESULTS    				There was no evidence of previous heart disease in 69 (23%); c) treatment: surgical treatment was undertaken in 102 (34%) episodes.
RESULTS    				The frequency of surgical treatment in relation to the etiologic agents ranged between 1% (non-group D streptococcus) and 62% (negative blood cultures).
RESULTS    				The frequency of operation in relation to underlying heart disease ranged between 17% (other heart diseases), 19% (congenital heart disease) and 54% (prosthetic heart valve); d) mortality: 78 (26%) patients died, 56 (28%) of the 198 submitted to medical treatment and 22 (21%) of the 102 submitted also to surgical treatment.
RESULTS    				The mortality in the different groups of etiologic agents ranged between 5% (non group D streptococcus) and 62% (gram-positive bacteria other than streptococci ans staphylococci); in relation to the underlying with other heart disease, 19% in valvular heart disease patients, 21% in patients with congenital heart disease, 23% in patients without known heart disease and 43% in patients with prosthetic heart valves.
CONCLUSIONS				The mortality associated with IE remains still high in spite of modern treatment; the mortality is different in relation to the cardiac status before the IE.

#### Influence of KATP channel modulation on net potassium efflux from ischaemic mammalian cardiac tissue.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to investigate the effect of pre-exposure to inhibitors or activators of the ATP regulated K+ (KATP) channels on the ischaemia induced early changes of the extracellular K+ concentration, the extracellular pH, and the action potential in mammalian cardiac tissue.
METHODS    				An in vitro model simulating ischaemia was applied to isolated guinea pig papillary muscles while simultaneous microelectrode measurements of the transmembrane potentials and of the pH and K+ activity at the surface of the preparation (pHs and asK respectively) were made.
RESULTS    				During conditions of superfusion arrest, when accumulation of metabolic acids causes acidification of pHs, the simultaneous development of a true hypoxic state of the muscle is required in order to induce shortening of the action potential duration and accumulation of extracellular K+ with associated membrane depolarisation.
RESULTS    				Glibenclamide (10-50 microM) slowed the decrease of the action potential duration in 50% of the muscles, while the increase of asK was only moderately (approximately 20%) influenced.
RESULTS    				In the presence of 200 microM of the KATP channel inhibitor, the mean K+ accumulation was not significantly different from the control.
RESULTS    				The presence of tolbutamide (1 mM) had no effect on the decrease of action potential duration, but moderately slowed the increase of asK. Superfusion with lemakalim (BRL 38227) decreased action potential duration dose dependently.
RESULTS    				In papillary muscles in which action potential duration was shortened to approximately 60% of the control duration by presuperfusion with lemakalim, a subsequent ischaemic episode did not increase but rather delayed the rise in asK. During simulated ischaemia in the presence of Ba2+ ions (1 mM), asK showed a transient decrease followed by a rise at a rate similar to that in the absence of Ba2+.
CONCLUSIONS				Early ischaemic K+ accumulation and surface acidification are relatively insensitive to KATP channel inhibition or activation prior to the ischaemic insult.
CONCLUSIONS				The rather loose coupling of the increase of asK and the decrease of action potential duration, as well as the limited effect of sulphonylureas on the K+ increase, suggests that mechanisms other than KATP channel opening could possibly contribute to the initial phase of ischaemic K+ accumulation.

#### Effects of diltiazem and noradrenaline on extracellular potassium changes in the globally ischaemic rat heart.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to investigate the effects of a calcium antagonist (diltiazem) and a catecholamine (noradrenaline) on extracellular potassium accumulation during global ischaemia.
METHODS    				Extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]e) was measured during 30 min global ischaemia in the isolated rat heart using a valinomycin potassium sensitive electrode.
METHODS    				Contracture development during ischaemia was measured throughout with an intraventricular balloon inserted into the left ventricle and myocardial adenine nucleotides were measured in separate series of hearts.
RESULTS    				In control hearts, [K+]e showed a characteristic triphasic change during 30 min global ischaemia.
RESULTS    				This consisted of an early rising phase followed by a transient falling phase after the initial peak of [K+]e, and then a late rising phase.
RESULTS    				Diltiazem suppressed the rate of rise of [K+]e during early ischaemia, but extended the time course of the early [K+]e rise with the higher dose, abolishing the transient falling phase of [K+]e.
RESULTS    				During late ischaemia, the rise in [K+]e was attenuated by diltiazem.
RESULTS    				Noradrenaline also suppressed the early extracellular potassium accumulation, but in contrast to diltiazem, hastened the time course of the late [K+]e rise.
CONCLUSIONS				Although diltiazem suppresses the early potassium loss during ischaemia as previously described, the drug also decreases the [K+]e fall by some as yet unknown mechanism, so that the [K+]e level becomes higher than control during the falling phase.

#### Effects of intracoronary cromakalim on postischaemic contractile function and action potential duration.

OBJECTIVE  				The effects of intracoronary cromakalim (1 microgram.kg-1 x min-1) on postischaemic contractile function and monophasic action potential duration at the 95% repolarisation level (APD95) were assessed in a canine model of stunned myocardium.
METHODS    				Animals (n = 24) were anaesthetised, subjected to a left thoracotomy, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was isolated.
METHODS    				Measurements of segmental shortening and monophasic action potential were taken before drug, after drug, during a 15 min occlusion, and at times following reperfusion.
RESULTS    				Cromakalim significantly improved reperfusion recovery of function.
RESULTS    				Both preischaemic and postischaemic myocardial blood flows were increased with cromakalim, although there was no significant change in collateral blood flow during ischaemia relative to vehicle.
RESULTS    				In the absence of ischaemia, cromakalim reduced APD95 by 8%.
RESULTS    				There was no change in APD95 with vehicle alone.
RESULTS    				During coronary occlusion, cromakalim significantly reduced APD95 by 27% as compared with 8% in the vehicle group.
RESULTS    				APD95 values returned to preocclusion levels within minutes of reperfusion and remained there throughout reperfusion (30 min).
RESULTS    				Glyburide (3.0 mg.kg-1 intravenously), a blocker of ATP sensitive potassium channels, abolished the APD95 effects of cromakalim.
RESULTS    				One out of six animals given glyburide survived through reperfusion.
RESULTS    				In contrast, four out of five of the glyburide+cromakalim treated animals survived through reperfusion.
CONCLUSIONS				Cardioprotection with cromakalim is likely to be mediated through activation of ATP sensitive potassium channels, measured as a decrease in action potential duration.
CONCLUSIONS				Shortening of action potential duration with cromakalim was shown to be augmented in the presence of ischaemia.
CONCLUSIONS				It is suggested that a possible interrelationship between cardioprotection and action potential duration shortening may exist such that the cardioprotective effects of cromakalim may be selective for ischaemic conditions.

#### Blockade of ischaemic preconditioning in dogs by the novel ATP dependent potassium channel antagonist sodium 5-hydroxydecanoate.

OBJECTIVE  				The aims were: (1) to determine if a new ischaemia selective ATP dependent potassium (KATP) channel antagonist, sodium 5-hydroxydecanoate (5-HD), blocks ischaemic preconditioning in dogs; (2) to determine whether a small intracoronary dose of glibenclamide, a classical sulphonylurea KATP channel antagonist, could block ischaemic preconditioning independent of systemic metabolic effects.
METHODS    				Barbitone anaesthetised dogs were subjected to 60 min of left circumflex coronary artery occlusion followed by 5 h of reperfusion.
METHODS    				Preconditioning was produced by a single 5 min left circumflex occlusion followed by 10 min of reperfusion prior to the 60 min occlusion period.
METHODS    				5-HD (150 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) or vehicle was given by intracoronary infusion into the ischaemic region over 20 min, beginning 15 min prior to the 60 min occlusion period in the presence or absence of preconditioning.
METHODS    				Glibenclamide (3 micrograms.kg-1 x min-1) was given by intracoronary infusion into the left circumflex artery during the 5 min preconditioning period or during the first 5 min of occlusion in preconditioned or non-preconditioned dogs.
METHODS    				Transmural myocardial blood flow was measured by radioactive microspheres and infarct size determined by triphenyltetrazolium staining and expressed as a percent of the area at risk.
RESULTS    				There were no differences in haemodynamic variables, myocardial blood flow, area at risk, or blood glucose between groups.
RESULTS    				Infarct size was markedly reduced in preconditioned dogs compared to control animals, at 7(SEM 2)% v 29(4)%, p < 0.05 The reduction in infarct size by preconditioning was blocked completely by intracoronary 5-HD, or by intracoronary glibenclamide given during preconditioning or during the first 5 min of the prolonged occlusion period.
RESULTS    				Neither 5-HD nor glibenclamide affected infarct size in the absence of preconditioning at the doses studied.
CONCLUSIONS				These results further strengthen the hypothesis that activation of myocardial KATP channels is involved in the mechanism of ischaemic preconditioning in dogs.

#### Effects of potassium channel modulation during global ischaemia in isolated rat heart with and without cardioplegia.

OBJECTIVE  				The opening of potassium (K+) channels during regional ischaemia may, by inducing rapid contractile arrest, be an intrinsic energy sparing mechanism.
OBJECTIVE  				Thus K+ channel openers (for example, lemakalim) exert significant anti-ischaemic effects, whereas glibenclamide exacerbates ischaemic contracture and limits postischaemic functional recovery.
OBJECTIVE  				The aim of the study was to investigate the ability of these compounds to influence ischaemic injury when used either alone or in combination with rapid arrest induced by a high K+ cardioplegic solution.
METHODS    				Contractile function of isolated Langendorff perfused rat hearts was assessed using an intraventricular balloon.
METHODS    				Hearts were subjected to normothermic global ischaemia (20 min) or cardioplegic arrest (35 min) with and without glibenclamide or lemakalim.
METHODS    				Lemakalim (10 mumol.litre-1) or glibenclamide (10 mumol.litre-1) was given, in the presence or absence of cardioplegia, for 2 min immediately prior to the onset of ischaemia.
METHODS    				The rate of ischaemia induced contractile failure, the severity of ischaemic contracture, and the degree of postischaemic functional recovery were all measured.
RESULTS    				In the absence of cardioplegia, the time to contractile arrest in control hearts was 133 (SEM 4) s. This was increased by glibenclamide, to 145(6) s, and decreased by lemakalim, to 112(6) s. The time to onset of ischaemic contracture [8(1) min] was accelerated by glibenclamide [4(1) min] and delayed by lemakalim [14(1) min].
RESULTS    				Lemakalim significantly improved the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure from 49(7)% in control hearts to 65(3)%, and left ventricular end diastolic pressure from 41(3) to 21(4) mm Hg.
RESULTS    				Hearts pretreated with glibenclamide showed similar recoveries to control hearts.
RESULTS    				During reperfusion, lemakalim exerted a transient vasodilator effect whereas glibenclamide caused a transient vasoconstriction.
RESULTS    				When either glibenclamide or lemakalim was added to a high K+ cardioplegic solution and hearts rendered ischaemic for 35 min, the ability of both compounds to influence ischaemic contracture and postischaemic functional recovery was lost.
RESULTS    				In additional studies the effect of lemakalim on the relative times to ischaemia induced mechanical failure and electrical arrest was assessed.
RESULTS    				In control hearts the time to contractile failure was 128(5) s and the time to electrical arrest was 241(30) s, while in the lemakalim treated hearts the values were 103(2) s and 509(161) s, respectively.
RESULTS    				In the lemakalim group all the hearts showed sustained ventricular arrhythmias; in the control group there were no arrhythmias.
CONCLUSIONS				Lemakalim can exert a significant anti-ischaemic effect when given alone.
CONCLUSIONS				This effect is lost when it is used in combination with high K+ cardioplegia.
CONCLUSIONS				The anti-ischaemic properties of lemakalim may thus be limited to its ability to accelerate contractile arrest.

#### Effects of glibenclamide on ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac function in ischaemia and reperfusion in isolated rat heart.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to investigate the effects of glibenclamide, a specific blocker of the ATP sensitive potassium channel, on the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias and the functional changes occurring during myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion.
METHODS    				Hearts (n = 10 per group) were obtained from male Wistar rats, weight 250-300 g. The study was performed in isolated Langendorff perfused rat hearts subjected to ligation of the left coronary artery and reperfusion.
METHODS    				Because of the occurrence of arrhythmias, cardiac function was not evaluated during reperfusion.
METHODS    				Glibenclamide (1 or 10 microM) was added to the perfusion solution before the coronary artery occlusion, during ischaemia or after reperfusion.
METHODS    				In some experiments the incidence of various durations of ischaemia (5, 10, 15, and 30 min) was evaluated.
RESULTS    				During the preischaemic period, glibenclamide induced a marked reduction in coronary flow, with a slight decrease in heart rate and left ventricular pressure.
RESULTS    				The ischaemia induced decrease in left ventricular pressure was markedly attenuated when glibenclamide was given before ischaemia.
RESULTS    				Thus the isovolumetric left ventricular pressure measured after 15 min ischaemia, which represents 59(SEM 6)% of the preischaemic value in the control group, was increased to 82(9) and 94(8)% in presence of glibenclamide (1 and 10 microM, p < 0.05 respectively).
RESULTS    				The effect was less pronounced when glibenclamide was added to the perfusion fluid during the ischaemic period.
RESULTS    				None of the hearts showed ventricular fibrillation during the ischaemic period.
RESULTS    				Glibenclamide (1 and 10 microM) did not reduce the incidence of reperfusion induced ventricular fibrillation.
RESULTS    				However, a defibrillatory action was observed since glibenclamide reduced the duration of ventricular fibrillation during reperfusion.
CONCLUSIONS				Glibenclamide may increase the probability of spontaneous termination of ventricular fibrillation and facilitate the restoration of the myocardial function during regional ischaemia.



### 1291085
#### Regulation of ATP sensitive potassium channel of isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes by sarcolemmal monocarboxylate transport.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to describe the effects of extracellular application of monocarboxylates (pyruvate, lactate, or acetate) on current through KATP channels (iK,ATP) in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes.
METHODS    				The iK,ATP was elicited during whole cell voltage clamping by application of metabolic poisons, 2,4-dinitrophenol (150 microM) or glucose free cyanide (1 mM) and could be blocked by glibenclamide (3 microM).
RESULTS    				Extracellular application of monocarboxylates, pyruvate (0.1-10 mM), L-lactate (0.1-10 mM), and acetate (10 mM) led to a rapid inhibition of iK,ATP--an effect which was fully reversible upon washout.
RESULTS    				Substances without any effect on iK,ATP were (10 mM each) gluconate, citrate, glutamate, creatine, succinate, and glycine.
RESULTS    				The mechanism underlying the effects of monocarboxylates on iK,ATP was unlikely to be related to an increased ATP production, since D-lactate (10 mM) essentially had the same effect on iK,ATP as the L-isomer of lactate.
RESULTS    				Furthermore, with intracellular dialysis of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (0.1-0.5 mM), which inhibits pyruvate uptake into mitochondria, extracellular pyruvate exerted the same inhibitory effect on iK,ATP.
RESULTS    				High concentrations of extracellular alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4 mM), which blocks the sarcolemmal monocarboxylate carrier, prevented the effects on iK,ATP by pyruvate, L-lactate, D-lactate, and acetate.
RESULTS    				Furthermore, intracellular dialysis with D-lactate (10 mM) led to a more rapid onset of iK,ATP when activated by ATP free dialysis.
RESULTS    				Activity of isolated KATP channels, measured in isolated membrane patches in the inside out or outside out configuration, typically had a single channel conductance of around 80 pS and was blocked by glibenclamide (3-9 microM).
RESULTS    				No significant effect of pyruvate was observed in either patch configuration.
CONCLUSIONS				In cardiac tissue there may be some modulatory role involving monocarboxylate transport on KATP channel activity, the nature of which is unclear at present but which may involve cytosolic pH changes.
CONCLUSIONS				Physiological and pathophysiological implications of these findings are discussed.

#### Comparative studies of ATP sensitive potassium channels in heart and pancreatic beta cells using Vaughan-Williams class Ia antiarrhythmics.

OBJECTIVE  				Actions of cibenzoline and disopyramide, agents with Vaughan-Williams class Ia antiarrhythmic action, on ATP sensitive K+ (KATP) channels were examined in heart and pancreatic beta cells.
METHODS    				Single ventricular myocytes and beta cells were prepared enzymatically from adult Wistar rat hearts and pancreatic islets.
METHODS    				Using patch clamp techniques, KATP channel activities were recorded in whole cell and single channel modes.
METHODS    				In whole cell experiments, myocytes were bathed with Tyrode's medium (34 degrees C); inside out patches were bathed with internal solutions (22-24 degrees C) containing 1 microM ATP and varying concentrations of cibenzoline or disopyramide.
METHODS    				Myocytes were voltage clamped at -40 mV and glibenclamide blockade conductance was produced by cromakalim.
RESULTS    				Micromolar concentrations of both cibenzoline and disopyramide suppressed cromakalim induced conductance.
RESULTS    				When applied to the cytosolic surface of the cell membrane in inside out configuration, both drugs reversibly inhibited single KATP channel activities.
RESULTS    				Neither unitary conductance nor intraburst fast kinetics was affected by the compounds.
RESULTS    				At a holding potential of -40 mV under symmetrical approximately 150 mM K+ conditions, half maximum doses (IC50) were 0.9 microM [Hill coefficient (h) = 1.3] for cibenzoline induced block of cardiac KATP channels and 1.8 microM (h = 1.0) for disopyramide block.
RESULTS    				At +40 mV, IC50 for cibenzoline block was 1.4 microM (h = 0.9).
RESULTS    				Thus there was little voltage dependence in cibenzoline induced channel block.
RESULTS    				A similar IC50 value of 2.5 microM (h = 1.2 at -60 mV under symmetrical approximately 150 mM K+) was observed for cibenzoline induced block of KATP channels.
CONCLUSIONS				Near therapeutic concentrations of cibenzoline and disopyramide inhibit KATP channel activities in both heart and pancreatic beta cells.
CONCLUSIONS				This may be causally related to the fasting hypoglycaemia which is sometimes reported in patients receiving the drugs.
CONCLUSIONS				These antiarrhythmic agents may also modulate myocardial electrical properties during hypoxia or ischaemia.

#### Dofetilide, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, reduces pacing induced heterogeneity of repolarisation in vivo.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to determine whether dofetilide, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, could reduce the heterogeneity of repolarisation produced by rapid cardiac pacing and to compare it with quinidine.
OBJECTIVE  				Increased heterogeneity of repolarisation times may be causally linked to malignant cardiac re-entrant arrhythmias.
METHODS    				Studies were performed in open chest, artificially ventilated, pentobarbitone anaesthetised beagle dogs of 13 to 15 kg body weight.
METHODS    				Myocardial electrocardiograms were simultaneously recorded from 31 electrodes located on the left and right ventricular surfaces of the in situ canine heart.
METHODS    				Recordings were obtained over a single cardiac cycle during rapid ventricular pacing at the maximum following frequency.
METHODS    				Computer assisted measurements of activation time, activation-repolarisation interval, and repolarisation time were performed and the heterogeneity of these measurements calculated.
METHODS    				Measurements were performed before treatment and after each incremental intravenous dose of dofetilide (3, 10, 30, and 100 micrograms.kg-1), quinidine (1, 3, and 10 mg.kg-1), or saline vehicle.
RESULTS    				Dofetilide increased repolarisation time via a selective prolongation of activation-repolarisation interval, activation time being unchanged.
RESULTS    				It reduced the heterogeneity of repolarisation time and activation-repolarisation interval, heterogeneity of activation time being unchanged.
RESULTS    				Quinidine increased repolarisation time by a non-selective increase of both activation-repolarisation interval and activation time.
RESULTS    				It increased the heterogeneity of activation times which offset a decrease in heterogeneity of activation-repolarisation intervals to produce no change in heterogeneity of repolarisation times.
CONCLUSIONS				Dofetilide, but not quinidine, reduces pacing induced asynchrony of repolarisation in the canine heart and this effect may contribute to its antiarrhythmic activity.

#### Blockade of 2,4-dinitrophenol induced ATP sensitive potassium current in guinea pig ventricular myocytes by class I antiarrhythmic drugs.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to assess the effects of various antiarrhythmic drugs on 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) induced outward current (IDNP), presumably the ATP sensitive K+ current (IK,ATP) of isolated cardiac cells and to discuss mechanisms involved in the hypoglycaemia which occurs in patients on these drugs.
METHODS    				The quasi-steady state current-voltage relationship from the isolated guinea pig ventricular cells was measured using whole cell voltage clamp techniques with a ramp pulse programme.
METHODS    				The effects of seven different antiarrhythmic drugs on IDNP were examined.
METHODS    				Action potentials were elicited at a rate of 0.2 Hz by an intracellular current injection.
RESULTS    				DNP (50 mumol.litre-1) increased the quasi-steady state outward current at potentials positive to about -60 mV. This current (IDNP) was completely inhibited by the subsequent application of glibenclamide (1 mumol.litre-1), thereby suggesting that the IDNP is probably IK,ATP.
RESULTS    				Cibenzoline (10 mumol.litre-1, class Ia), disopyramide (30 mumol.litre-1, class Ia), and procainamide (100 mumol.litre-1, class Ia) significantly inhibited the IDNP by 95.5(SD 11.3)%, 77.8(21.2)%, and 76.4(23.9)% respectively.
RESULTS    				Flecainide (class 1c) inhibited the IDNP by 66.9(23.9)% at 10 mumol.litre-1 but not at 2 mumol.litre-1.
RESULTS    				Mexiletine (30 mumol.litre-1, class Ib), pilsicainide (50 mumol.litre-1, class Ic), and E4031 (10 mumol.litre-1, class III) at concentrations as high as approximately fivefold the clinically effective blood levels, did not suppress IDNP.
RESULTS    				Except for 10 mumol.litre-1 flecainide, all the concentrations listed above which blocked IDNP were within twofold of the clinical blood concentrations documented to be effective for suppression of arrhythmias.
RESULTS    				Cibenzoline, disopyramide, and procainamide, but not flecainide, belong to class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs.
RESULTS    				All these class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs "shortened" the action potential duration of guinea pig ventricular cells, an opposite change to that noted for multicellular preparations, eg, guinea pig papillary muscles.
CONCLUSIONS				Class Ia antiarrhythmic drugs (cibenzoline, disopyramide, and procainamide) inhibit IDNP (presumably IK,ATP) in guinea pig ventricular cells within a range of therapeutic concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS				This inhibitory effect of IK,ATP can probably explain the hypoglycaemia which occurs in some patients receiving these drugs, and the prolongation of the action potential duration alleged to occur in "superfused" papillary muscles.

#### Class III antiarrhythmic action by potassium channel blockade: dofetilide attenuates hypoxia induced electromechanical changes.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to examine the electromechanical effects of dofetilide, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, in isolated guinea pig ventricular muscle during hypoxia.
METHODS    				Hypoxia was induced by superfusing guinea pig right ventricular papillary, muscles with Tyrode's solution gassed with 95% N2 + 5% CO2 [PO2 = 5.3(SEM 1.3) kPa].
METHODS    				Prior to hypoxia, the preparations were either pretreated for 30 min with 0.1 microM dofetilide (n = 6) or with 100 microM glibenclamide (a blocker of ATP sensitive K+ channels, n = 6), or not pretreated (n = 6).
METHODS    				Sixteen additional preparations were exposed to 1 mM nicorandil (an activator of ATP sensitive K+ channels) in the absence (n = 6) and presence of dofetilide (n = 6) or glibenclamide (n = 4).
METHODS    				Transmembrane action potentials and developed force were recorded using conventional microelectrode techniques and a force transducer.
RESULTS    				During normoxia, dofetilide markedly increased APD90 from 236(SEM 6) ms to 298(7) ms (p < 0.05) and the effective refractory period (ERP) from 248(5) ms to 315(6) ms (p < 0.05).
RESULTS    				In the drug free group, 60 min hypoxia decreased APD90 by 47(5)% (p < 0.05), ERP by 48(4)% (p < 0.05) and developed force by 71(6)% (p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively.
RESULTS    				These hypoxia induced effects were significantly attenuated after pretreatment with dofetilide or glibenclamide.
RESULTS    				Nicorandil decreased APD90 by 45(5)% (p < 0.05), ERP by 44(6)% (p < 0.05), and developed force by 69(10)% (p < 0.05) of baseline, respectively.
RESULTS    				Pretreatment with dofetilide or glibenclamide also significantly attenuated the nicorandil induced decreases in APD90, ERP, and developed force.
CONCLUSIONS				Dofetilide, like glibenclamide, effectively attenuates hypoxia and nicorandil induced action potential shortening and the associated reduction in contractile force.
CONCLUSIONS				Thus dofetidile would be expected to retain its antiarrhythmic efficacy during myocardial hypoxia or ischaemia.

#### Antiarrhythmic and electrophysiological effects of amiodarone, lignocaine, and penticainide in anaesthetised rats.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to correlate the relative abilities of amiodarone, lignocaine, and penticainide in suppressing ventricular tachyarrhythmias in response to coronary artery occlusion with their relative abilities to prolong ventricular functional refractory periods and to reduce intraventricular conduction velocities in anaesthetised open chest rats.
METHODS    				Functional refractory period was measured with a paired electrical stimulation technique.
METHODS    				Intraventricular conduction velocity was monitored using the QRS duration of the ECG.
RESULTS    				Low doses of these three drugs were selected which protected against ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by coronary occlusion.
RESULTS    				These doses prolonged the functional refractory period without increasing QRS duration.
RESULTS    				High doses of both amiodarone and lignocaine were more effective than low doses in suppressing coronary occlusion induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
RESULTS    				Such high doses greatly prolonged the functional refractory period but prolonged the QRS duration only moderately.
RESULTS    				In contrast, higher doses of penticainide failed to inhibit coronary occlusion induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
RESULTS    				These higher doses of penticainide prolonged the functional refractory period but prolonged the QRS duration even more markedly.
CONCLUSIONS				Among these three drugs an increase in functional refractory period appears to be antiarrhythmic.
CONCLUSIONS				In contrast, widening of the QRS complex without a corresponding increase in functional refractory period, as produced by penticainide, appears to counteract the antiarrhythmic effect.

#### Differential block of cardiac delayed rectifier current by class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs: evidence for open channel block and unblock.

OBJECTIVE  				The aim was to compare the effects of the class Ic antiarrhythmic drugs flecainide, encainide, and recainam on the delayed rectifier current, IK.
METHODS    				Membrane currents were studied using the single suction pipette voltage clamp technique in freshly dissociated cat ventricular myocytes bathed in HEPES buffered physiological saline at 32 degrees C.
RESULTS    				Flecainide and encainide decreased IK with IC50 values of 2.1 microM and 6 microM, respectively.
RESULTS    				Recainam (100 microM) reduced IK by only 7 (SEM 3)% after 20-30 min exposure and by 19% after an 80 min exposure (IC50 > 400 microM).
RESULTS    				None of the compounds blocked the inward rectifier, IK1.
RESULTS    				Block of IK by flecainide and encainide increased with depolarisation following a voltage dependence similar to that describing channel activation.
RESULTS    				Flecainide and encainide also slowed the time course of the IK tail currents, consistent with drug dissociating from open channels.
CONCLUSIONS				The observed voltage dependence for IK block by flecainide and encainide resembles the interaction reported between these agents and the excitatory sodium channel, ie, depolarisation enhances block while repolarisation leads to removal of block.
CONCLUSIONS				The results further suggest that the electrophysiological profile of class Ic agents can have a markedly different ionic basis, ie, K+ channel block by flecainide and encainide is balanced by a potent block of sodium channels, while recainam appears to be a weak but relatively specific blocker of sodium channels only.
CONCLUSIONS				These differences are not readily accommodated by the current Harrison-Vaughan-Williams classification scheme, and suggest the possibility that potentially important drug specific differences can exist within the same antiarrhythmic drug class.

#### Differential inhibition of potassium currents in rat ventricular myocytes by capsaicin.

OBJECTIVE  				Capsaicin is a pungent irritant present in peppers of the Capsicum family.
OBJECTIVE  				Its major target of action is believed to be sensory neurones.
OBJECTIVE  				Capsaicin has also been shown to prolong cardiac action potential in atrial muscle, perhaps by local release of calcitonin gene related peptide which in turn enhances inward calcium currents.
OBJECTIVE  				However, capsaicin has been shown to inhibit K+ current in neurones.
OBJECTIVE  				Since such an action could contribute to action potential prolonging activity of capsaicin in heart, the aim of the study was to examine the effects of capsaicin on cardiac K+ currents.
METHODS    				Ionic currents and action potentials were examined in isolated adult rat ventricular myocytes using the whole cell variant of the patch clamp technique at 25 degrees C.
RESULTS    				Capsaicin (10 microM) increased the action potential duration (APD50) from 45 ms to 166 ms.
RESULTS    				This effect was associated with an inhibition of three distinct K+ currents.
RESULTS    				The decreasing rank order of potency was: transient outward K+ current (ITO, IC50 = 6.4 microM), a voltage dependent non-inactivating outward current (IK, IC = 11.5 microM), and the inward rectifier K+ current (IK1, IC50 = 46.9 microM).
RESULTS    				Capsaicin induced block of ITO was characterised by a decrease in the peak current amplitude and an increase in the rate of inactivation.
RESULTS    				The inactivation of ITO in the absence of capsaicin was well described by a single exponential [tau = 77 (SEM 2) ms at +40 mV, n = 10].
RESULTS    				However, in the presence of 10 microM capsaicin inactivation was best described by the sum of two exponentials [tau FAST = 4.4(0.5) ms; tau SLOW = 92.4(3.0) ms, n = 10] with the fast component contributing 46(2)% of the total decay.
RESULTS    				A small but consistent hyperpolarising shift (approximately 3 mV) in the steady state voltage dependence of inactivation of ITO was induced by 10 microM capsaicin.
RESULTS    				Capsaicin had no effect on the rate of ITO recovery from inactivation (tau = 49 ms and 48 ms for control and drug respectively).
RESULTS    				The capsaicin analogue, resiniferatoxin, which as an irritant is up to 10(4)-fold more potent than capsaicin, had no effect on any of the K+ currents when present at concentrations of up to 10 microM. In contrast another capsaicin analogue, zingerone (30 microM) blocked ITO by 52(12)% and IK by 35%.
CONCLUSIONS				Capsaicin produces a prolongation of the rat ventricular action potential, an effect which is associated with inhibition of potassium currents.

#### Differential effects of the new class III antiarrhythmic agents almokalant, E-4031 and D-sotalol, and of quinidine, on delayed rectifier currents in guinea pig ventricular myocytes.

OBJECTIVE  				The effects of almokalant (4-[3-ethyl[3-(propylsulphinyl)propyl]-amino]-2-hydroxy-propoxy]- benzonitrile), E-4031 (1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridyl)-ethyl]-4-(4-methylsulphonyl-amino- benzoyl)piperidine), d-sotalol, and quinidine were investigated on the delayed K+ rectifier current IK.
OBJECTIVE  				The aim of the study was to compare the drug action on the two components of this current.
METHODS    				Membrane currents were measured in ventricular myocytes from guinea pig hearts with the whole cell voltage clamp technique.
METHODS    				IK was activated during clamp steps from a holding potential of -40 mV to test potentials -30 and +50 mV. The tail current Itail was measured upon stepping back to holding potential.
RESULTS    				In control experiments.
RESULTS    				IK and Itail declined spontaneously ("run down").
RESULTS    				With 300 ms long test pulses to +50 mV, only d-sotalol (10(-4) M) caused a significant further decrease in IK, whereas all four agents significantly reduced Itail (almokalant 10(-6) M, E-4031 10(-7) M, quinidine 10(-5) M).
RESULTS    				When tested with 1 s long clamp steps at various potentials almokalant (3 x 10(-6) M), E-4031 (10(-6) M), quinidine (10(-5) M), and d-sotalol (10(-4) M) reduced IK in the potential range between -20 and +40 mV, yielding a bell shaped inward rectifying drug sensitive current.
RESULTS    				Itail was reduced by almokalant and E-4031 over the whole voltage range with saturation of block positive to +20 mV. Similar reductions with quinidine but not with d-sotalol were also significant.
RESULTS    				With rest pulses to +50 mV of increasing duration (25 ms-4000 ms), Itail developed with a faster time course than IK and therefore the ratio of Itail/IK declined with pulse duration.
RESULTS    				With almokalant and E-4031, this ratio became independent of test pulse duration.
RESULTS    				For 250 ms pulses, Itail/IK was also significantly reduced by d-sotalol and quinidine.
CONCLUSIONS				Inhibition of the rapidly activating inwardly rectifying component of IK is prominent with almokalant and E-4031 and less pronounced with d-sotalol and quinidine.
CONCLUSIONS				Since inhibition of this component prolongs the cardiac action potential, it should contribute to the antiarrhythmic properties of the agents.

#### [Follow-up of patients undergoing surgery for aortic dissection: evaluation with transesophageal echocardiography].

BACKGROUND 				Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a useful means in the diagnosis of acute aortic dissection (AD), owing to its very high sensibility and specificity.
BACKGROUND 				In this study, TEE was performed to assess post-surgical evolution.
METHODS    				Between 1982 and 1991, 119 pts.
METHODS    				were operated on in our institution for AD (De Bakey I and II type): 87 pts.
METHODS    				underwent replacement of the ascending aorta with a composite tubular graft bearing a mechanical valve; 26 had a simple tubular graft and 6 had aortic reconstruction.
METHODS    				Sixty-eight of 72 discharged pts.
METHODS    				were followed for up to 9.5 years (mean 4.5 +/- 2.6).
METHODS    				Nine years after surgery actuarial survival of discharged pts.
METHODS    				was 75%.
METHODS    				Seven pts.
METHODS    				died after a mean period of 3.4 years from surgery: only one died from postoperative complication (dehiscence of proximal anastomosis), none for aortic rupture distal to the graft.
METHODS    				TEE was performed in 32 of these pts.
METHODS    				and in other two operated on elsewhere, after 4.4 +/- 2.7 years from surgery; before the operation, type I AD was diagnosed in 23 pts.
METHODS    				and type II in 11 pts.
RESULTS    				In 10/11 pts.
RESULTS    				with type II AD the aortic arch and the descending aorta looked normal; in one patient a localized intimal flap was found up to the arch.
RESULTS    				The descending aorta diameter was somewhat higher than in normal subjects (25.2 +/- 2.8 vs 21.9 +/- 3.7 mm), but in only one case was it beyond 2DS (32 mm).
RESULTS    				In all type I pts.
RESULTS    				an intimal flap persisted distal to the graft, along the whole thoracic aorta.
RESULTS    				Within the false lumen a flow was detected by color-Doppler in 14/23 pts. (
RESULTS    				61%), and spontaneous echo-contrast was noted in 14 pts. (
RESULTS    				61%).
RESULTS    				A thrombus was observed in 7 pts. (
RESULTS    				30%) and it was generally localized; in only one case it was extensive with total obliteration of the false lumen.
RESULTS    				In 16 pts. (
RESULTS    				70%) communications between the two lumina were found.
RESULTS    				The descending aorta diameter ranged from 25 to 53 mm, and mean value was higher than in normal subjects (34.2 +/- 6.2 vs 21.9 +/- 3.7 mm).
CONCLUSIONS				In most pts.
CONCLUSIONS				with type II AD, surgery can be a definitive treatment, as the remaining aorta keeps to normal size and appearance.
CONCLUSIONS				In type I AD, operation is only palliative, as the dissection persists: the false lumen is often perfused through one or more communications with the true lumen and seldom its obliteration is noted.
CONCLUSIONS				The persistence of dissection does not necessarily seem to be an ominous finding, as the survival of the study population was high and no patient died from aortic rupture.
CONCLUSIONS				Nevertheless, long-term prognosis can be affected by aorta dilation that often (but not always) follows the persistence of wall dissection.
CONCLUSIONS				For its high reliability, easy feasibility and low cost TEE is a very useful method for following up patients operated on for AD and for detecting those who are at higher risk of aortic rupture because of lumen dilation.

#### [Prognostic value of the dipyridamole-echocardiography test immediately after a non-complicated myocardial infarct: a large scale multicenter study. Echo Persantine Italian Cooperative Study].

BACKGROUND 				Any new diagnostic test should follow a pathway similar to that of a new drug, from initial studies in highly selected populations under strictly controlled conditions, up to large scale multicenter trials more likely to represent the true performance of the test in the clinical arena.
OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the capability of prognostic stratification of high dose (up to 0.84 mg/kg over 10') dipyridamole-echocardiography test (DET) early after an acute myocardial infarction in a "phase IV" study, based upon 11 different echocardiographic laboratories, all with established experience in stress echo and fulfilling quality control requirements for stress echo readings.
METHODS    				Nine-hundred twenty five patients were evaluated after a mean of 10 days from an acute myocardial infarction and followed up for a mean of 14 months.
RESULTS    				During DET, one major adverse reaction occurred, consisting of a prolonged ischemia resistant to aminophylline and nitrates, and progressing to small uncomplicated reinfarction.
RESULTS    				In 11 patients the lower dipyridamole dose (0.56 mg/kg over 4') gave limiting side effects.
RESULTS    				Patients were followed up for 14 +/- 9.9 months (range = 1.53).
RESULTS    				During the follow-up, there were 34 deaths and 37 non-fatal myocardial infarctions; 104 patients developed class III or IV angina, and 149 had coronary revascularization procedures (bypass or angioplasty).
RESULTS    				Considering all spontaneous events (angina, reinfarction and death), the most important univariate predictor was the result of DET (chi-square = 45.8).
RESULTS    				With a Cox analysis, echocardiographic positivity, age and sex were found to have an independent and additive value.
RESULTS    				Considering survival (and therefore death as the only event) age was the most meaningful parameter, followed by the Wall Motion Score Index during dipyridamole (chi-square = 12.1); among other parameters, the resting Wall Motion Score Index was a significant predictor of death.
RESULTS    				By Cox analysis, age (relative risk estimate = 1.02) and Wall Motion Score Index during dipyridamole (relative risk estimate = 14) showed an independent and additional prognostic value.
RESULTS    				In particular, considering death only, the event rate was of 2% in patients with negative DET, 4% in patients with high dose positive DET and 7% in patients with low dose positive DET.
CONCLUSIONS				Dipyridamole echocardiography is feasible and safe early after uncomplicated myocardial infarction and allows an effective risk stratification on the basis of the presence, severity, extent and timing of the induced dyssynergy.
CONCLUSIONS				In particular, the risk of death doubles in patients with high dose positivity and almost quadruples in patients with low dose positivity.

#### [Long-term treatment of stable angina pectoris with gallopamil].

BACKGROUND 				The effects of long-term treatment with gallopamil 50 mg t.i.d were assessed in 8 patients, 7 males and 1 female, aged 47-69 years, with stable angina pectoris, positive exercise tests, coronary artery disease and no previous myocardial infarction.
METHODS    				Clinical and ECG parameters as well as exercise testing, 24-hour Holter and echocardiography were assessed before treatment, after 3 months, after 1 and 2 years of treatment, and following final wash-out.
RESULTS    				Comparing each treatment period to baseline, a significant decrease in resting heart rate (from 66 +/- 9 beats/min at baseline to 56 +/- 7 beats/min after 3 months [p < 0.01], 59 +/- 8 beats/min after 1 year [p < 0.05] and 58 +/- 9 beats/min after 2 years [p < 0.05]), systolic (from 162 +/- 19 mmHg at baseline to 147 +/- 12 mmHg after 3 months [p < 0.05], 146 +/- 20 mmHg after 1 year [p < 0.01] and 146 +/- 27 mmHg after 2 years [p < 0.05]), and diastolic (from 89 +/- 6 mmHg to 82 +/- 7 after 3 months [p < 0.05], 82 +/- 4 after 1 year [p < 0.05] and 83 +/- 4 after 2 years [p < 0.05]) blood pressure was observed.
RESULTS    				Exercise time significantly improved (from 596 +/- 209 seconds to 802 +/- 66 seconds after 3 months [p < 0.01], 710 +/- 167 seconds after 1 year [p < 0.05] and 723 +/- 125 seconds after 2 year [p < 0.05]), while heart rate and rate-pressure product at peak exercise did not change.
RESULTS    				The number of ischemic episodes and the total ischemic time per 24 hours significantly decreased (from 35 +/- 15 min to 12 +/- 10 min after 3 months [p < 0.05], 10 +/- 8 min after 1 year [p < 0.05] and 11 +/- 9 min after 2 years [p < 0.05]).
RESULTS    				Ejection fraction increased (from 66 +/- 10% to 77 +/- 7% after 3 months [p < 0.01], 80 +/- 5% after 1 year [p < 0.01] and 80 +/- 3% after 2 years [p < 0.01]), while contractility, as expressed by the end-systolic stress/end systolic volume ratio remained unchanged.
RESULTS    				No serious side-effects or biochemical abnormalities developed.
CONCLUSIONS				Gallopamil appears to be safe, well tolerated and effective in the long term control of angina pectoris; its effects are fully developed at 3 months and persist unchanged after 2 years.
CONCLUSIONS				For its hypotensive action and the lack of significant effects on myocardial contractility, gallopamil appears to be potentially useful in patients with associated angina and hypertension and in patients with impaired left ventricular function.

#### The microcirculation and hypertension.

OBJECTIVE  				To review published evidence on the effects of arteriolar changes in primary and secondary hypertension.
BACKGROUND 				Pressure profile analyses have shown that the microcirculation is a major site of vascular resistance.
BACKGROUND 				With the recent refinement of intravital microscopy techniques detailed information has become available on mechanisms of the microvascular resistance increase in hypertension.
BACKGROUND 				Three mechanisms play an important role: (1) a decrease in arteriolar diameter; (2) arteriolar vessel wall hypertrophy; and (3) small arteriolar and capillary rarefaction.
METHODS    				The evidence was synthesized into a hypothesis on the role of the microcirculation in primary forms of hypertension.
OBJECTIVE  				The hypothesis formulated contains two important elements in that (1) diminished outgrowth of the microvascular bed in different tissues is seen as an important early pathogenic mechanism; and (2) the decreases in arteriolar diameter and vessel wall hypertrophy are seen as adaptive mechanisms that maintain a constant wall stress.
OBJECTIVE  				The three factors together maintain the increase in vascular resistance that is common to all established forms of primary hypertension.

#### Deficient production of nitric oxide induces volume-dependent hypertension.

OBJECTIVE  				To study the influence of nitric oxide on renal function.
METHODS    				Nitric oxide synthesis was inhibited and the effects on renal parameters were determined.
METHODS    				Nitric oxide synthesis was progressively blocked by the intravenous administration of increasing doses of NG-nitro-arginine methylester (L-NAME) and then (c)GMP was administered.
RESULTS    				The blockade of nitric oxide synthesis first induced a marked fall in urinary sodium excretion, and later, a sustained increase in mean arterial pressure.
RESULTS    				These effects were reversed by 8-bromide cGMP.
RESULTS    				Nitric oxide-dependent cGMP formation was higher in the inner medulla than in any other part of the renal parenchyma, and the inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis significantly decreased both pressure- and volume expansion-induced natriuresis.
CONCLUSIONS				Both the natriuretic and vasodilator tone maintained by nitric oxide are ultimately due to the production of cGMP.
CONCLUSIONS				Nitric oxide-induced formation of cGMP appears to be the major factor that links changes in renal medullary circulation to those of sodium excretion.
CONCLUSIONS				Sufficient inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis to decrease sodium excretion without altering blood pressure induces volume-dependent hypertension because blood pressure is elevated by an increased sodium intake.



### 1291655
#### The fetal origins of adult hypertension.

OBJECTIVE  				To elucidate the fetal origins of hypertension.
METHODS    				A systematic search was made for records of early growth, comprising measurements taken either at birth and/or during infancy, for groups of men and women now in middle-late life.
METHODS    				Over 25,000 men and women born before 1931 were successfully traced.
RESULTS    				Retarded growth in fetal life was strongly related to high blood pressure in adult life.
CONCLUSIONS				Hypertension is programmed by an adverse environment in utero.
CONCLUSIONS				It is linked to impaired development in both early and late gestation.

#### Advances in the community control of hypertension: from epidemiology to primary care practice.

OBJECTIVE  				To review the progress in hypertension control in the United States since 1972, to examine the factors that contributed to that progress and to consider areas in which further improvement is required.
METHODS    				A review of epidemiological, clinical and health services research related to hypertension control was conducted.
METHODS    				We report our experience in evaluating hypertension control in a multi-ethnic community clinic population as an illustration of the challenges of hypertension management in primary care practice.
RESULTS    				Hypertension prevalence in the United States population has remained relatively stable, whereas actual blood pressure levels in the population have declined slightly.
RESULTS    				Most Americans (approximately 80%) have had a blood pressure check within the past year, but the rate of blood pressure control in treated hypertensives has been disappointing.
RESULTS    				The current diagnostic and therapeutic criterion of blood pressure < or = 140/90 mmHg, regardless of individual patient characteristics (e.g. age, race), should be re-evaluated.



### 1291658
#### Blood pressure disturbance in diabetes mellitus.

BACKGROUND 				Arterial hypertension and, less often, postural hypotension are frequently associated with diabetes mellitus, and with diabetic complications and death.
OBJECTIVE  				To review data on the relationship between hypertension and nephropathy in diabetes mellitus.
METHODS    				We reviewed data on both retinopathy and nephropathy in hypertensive diabetic patients.
METHODS    				Data suggesting that vasopressin levels might affect blood pressure in upright patients with postural hypotension due to cardiocirculatory diabetic neuropathy were also examined.
METHODS    				Antihypertensive treatment during different phases of diabetic nephropathy in insulin-dependent diabetes was reviewed.
RESULTS    				The data showed that hydrochlorothiazide and nitrendipine reduce urinary protein excretion in parallel with a reduction in blood pressure.
RESULTS    				However, the decreases in urinary protein excretion induced by captopril are not correlated with a reduction in blood pressure and may be related to decreases in intraglomerular pressure found in patients with mild renal failure taking furosemide.
RESULTS    				Domperidone, a peripherally acting dopaminergic antagonist is an additional therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetic postural hypotension.



### 1291659
#### Cerebral vascular changes during chronic hypertension: good guys and bad guys.

OBJECTIVE  				To examine new concepts concerning structural changes in cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension, and to examine mechanisms that lead to cerebral vascular complications, in light of the hypothesis that hypertensive vascular hypertrophy may be harmful.
METHODS    				Literature review.
RESULTS    				The evidence suggests that the current view is not correct in relation to the cerebral circulation.
RESULTS    				Vascular hypertrophy and remodeling appear to protect cerebral vessels during hypertension, instead of being harmful.
RESULTS    				Major cerebral vascular complications during hypertension may be largely due to endothelial dysfunction.
RESULTS    				One function of the cerebral endothelium is to serve as the blood-brain barrier.
RESULTS    				Disruption of the blood-brain barrier appears to mediate hypertensive encephalopathy.
RESULTS    				A second endothelial function is to modulate vascular tone.
RESULTS    				Abnormalities in vasoactive factors that are released by the endothelium (impaired vasodilator mechanisms and augmented vasoconstrictor mechanisms) may make an important contribution to the pathophysiology of transient ischemic episodes, and perhaps stroke, in chronic hypertension.



### 1291660
#### Epidemiology and prevention of blood pressure-related renal disease.

OBJECTIVE  				To examine the relationship between blood pressure and end-stage renal disease.
METHODS    				Review of recent reports on blood pressure in relation to renal function.
BACKGROUND 				The incidence and prevalence of treated end-stage renal disease are increasing progressively in economically developed countries.
BACKGROUND 				To combat this problem, the treatment of established end-stage renal disease must be complemented by strategies to treat and prevent risk factors for the development of renal failure.
RESULTS    				Severe hypertension and malignant hypertension are well accepted as risk factors for renal insufficiency.
RESULTS    				Recent reports suggest a strong relationship between blood pressure and renal function, throughout the entire range of blood pressure.
RESULTS    				Most blood pressure-related renal disease can probably be attributed to mild hypertension or a high normal blood pressure.
CONCLUSIONS				Additional clinical trials are needed to assess the value of different antihypertensive drugs and different levels of blood pressure control in preserving renal function in subjects at risk of blood pressure-related renal disease.
CONCLUSIONS				Primary prevention of hypertension may be an important complement to the treatment of established hypertension in reducing the burden of renal disease in the community.



### 1291661
#### Renal consequences of arterial hypertension.

OBJECTIVE  				To seek ways of improving the prognosis for renal function in the presence of arterial hypertension.
BACKGROUND 				Nephrosclerosis is a term used to define the renal damage induced by arterial hypertension.
BACKGROUND 				The renal vasculature can participate in the genesis of essential hypertension and can suffer the consequences of elevated blood pressure.
BACKGROUND 				There is no doubt that antihypertensive therapy has dramatically improved the prognosis for renal function in the presence of arterial hypertension.
RESULTS    				There appears to be a need for a further improvement in the prognosis for renal hypertension.
RESULTS    				At present, the prevalence of nephrosclerosis as a cause of terminal renal failure may be increasing and a progressive fall in renal function in treated hypertensive patients compared to normotensives has been described.
CONCLUSIONS				It is not yet clear whether improvements in renal hypertension depend merely on the effectiveness of antihypertensive therapy in reducing arterial blood pressure or whether it will be necessary to improve the metabolic disturbances that accompany hypertension or the renal hemodynamic effects of different drugs before the prognosis for nephrosclerosis can be improved.

#### Comparison between late onset and childhood asthma.

BACKGROUND 				The onset of asthma frequently occurs after the age of 50 yr and the severity and causes of this late onset disease are poorly known.
METHODS    				25 chronic asthmatics (65.7 +/- 6.5 yr) whose asthma started after the age of 50 yr were compared with 23 chronic asthmatic children (11.6 +/- 2.8 yr) and 24 COPD patients (61.6 +/- 3.4 yr).
METHODS    				Both asthmatic groups had a similar apparent duration of asthma.
METHODS    				None of the asthmatics was a smoker.
METHODS    				All COPD were smokers.
METHODS    				The severity of asthma was defined according to the Aas score.
METHODS    				FVC, FEV1, MMEFR, Raw were tested and reversibility of bronchial obstruction was determined on Raw after salbutamol inhalation.
METHODS    				Allergy was assessed by skin prick tests, RAST and total serum IgE (PRIST).
RESULTS    				Patients with childhood asthma had: 1) a significantly lower clinical severity of asthma; 2) a significantly less severe bronchial obstruction, and 3) a significantly greater reversibility than old age asthmatics.
RESULTS    				There was no significant difference between pulmonary function tests pre- and post-bronchodilators between COPD and old-age asthmatics.
RESULTS    				All asthmatic children and 40% of older patients were allergic.
CONCLUSIONS				The occurrence of asthma in old age patients leads to a more severe course of the disease and allergy appears to play a role in many old age patients.

#### [Tuberculous meningitis in patients without HIV infection. Presentation of 21 cases].

BACKGROUND 				Tuberculous meningitis accounts for 5% to 12% of all extrapulmonary tuberculosis cases in western-hemisphere population non infected by HIV virus, and carries a high mortality rate.
METHODS    				We analyze retrospectively 21 patients with tuberculous meningitis in HIV negative patients seen from 1975 to 1989, with emphasis on clinical, laboratory and therapeutic features.
RESULTS    				In 48% of cases there were not typical meningeal signs, and 61% of patients showed neurological focal signs and/or seizures.
RESULTS    				CSF examination revealed a clear fluid with high cell counts (mostly lymphocytes), high protein and low sugar levels in 67% of cases.
RESULTS    				However, the microbiologic examination had a low yield of diagnosis (33%).
RESULTS    				The clinical course is prolonged, and treatment is usually delayed.
RESULTS    				Morbidity and mortality were high (34% and 10% of cases).
RESULTS    				In this study, the use of steroids did not show a significant reduction in mortality nor in neurological sequelae.
CONCLUSIONS				Tuberculous meningitis in HIV negative patients is a chronic infection, without meningeal signs in most cases and linked to a high rate of neurological defects.
CONCLUSIONS				The microbiologic tests have low yield of diagnosis.
CONCLUSIONS				Steroid drugs seem to be indicated only if there are additional complications.

#### [Molecular study of ampicillin resistance in clinical isolates of Salmonella].

BACKGROUND 				The purpose of this work was to study the molecular basis of beta-lactamase production in ampicillin-resistant strains of Salmonella spp.
METHODS    				It was performed analytical isoelectric focusing of beta-lactamases produced by a group of 33 strains selected in basis of their resistance phenotype.
METHODS    				Plasmid profile analysis and assays of transferable drug resistance were developed.
METHODS    				The study was completed by hybridization experiments with an intragenic TEM probe which allowed the location of the bla-TEM gene.
RESULTS    				By analytical isoelectrofocusing we found that 26 out of the 27 ampicillin-resistant strains produced beta-lactamases with pl 5.4 and/or 5.6 corresponding to TEM-1 and/or TEM-2 type.
RESULTS    				Analysis of plasmid DNA revealed in almost all strains plasmids ranging in size from 1.1 to 125 Mdal.
RESULTS    				This plasmids were responsible of the resistance and, moreover, were able to transfer the resistance by conjugation mechanisms.
RESULTS    				Southern blot analysis detected the gene that code the TEM beta-lactamase at the 125, 8 and 5.8 Mdal plasmids.
CONCLUSIONS				Resistance to ampicillin in the strains of Salmonella studied was due to the presence of TEM type beta-lactamases coded by conjugative plasmids.
CONCLUSIONS				These plasmids coded also resistance to other antimicrobial agents.
CONCLUSIONS				Our results showed that the use of a DNA probe to the detect TEM-type beta-lactamases using a non radioactive probe, could be a suitable alternative to isoelectric focusing.

#### [Mycobacteriosis during 1980-1990 in a Madrid hospital].

BACKGROUND 				To assess the incidence and features of environmental mycobacteria that can produce disease over a ten years period (1980-1990) in an University Hospital from Madrid (Spain).
METHODS    				Medical records of all patients in whom and environmental mycobacteria that can produce disease had been isolated were reviewed and classified as definite, possible or not clinically significant isolates, according to clinical features and microbiologic findings.
RESULTS    				Mycobacterium species were isolated in 415 patients (491 clinical samples over a total of 3003, 16.3%).
RESULTS    				In 29 patients a environmental mycobacteria that can produce disease was identified.
RESULTS    				Medical records from 25 patients were retrieved, being this mycobacteria isolated classified as with definite clinical significance in 8 cases, with possible clinical significance in 4, and without clinical significance in 13 cases.
RESULTS    				Clinical features in the significant cases were: lung infection (3 cases), pleural and pericardial disease (1 case), peritonitis (1) and soft tissue infection (1) Two patients died.
RESULTS    				Surgical excision of the lesion was performed in the remaining patients, and clinical cure was achieved in five cases.
CONCLUSIONS				The most prevalent mycobacterial infection in our environment is still due to M. tuberculosis infection, followed by M.avium-intracellulare.
CONCLUSIONS				Surgical treatment is a valid approach in patients with localized infection by environmental mycobacteria that can produce diseases.

#### Illness behavior in children of chronic pain patients.

OBJECTIVE  				Recent studies on pain behavior have pointed to a relationship between expression of illness in patients with chronic pain and reports of physical complaints in other family members.
OBJECTIVE  				This article includes two related studies.
OBJECTIVE  				The aim of the first study was to determine whether, among pain patient families, parents who exhibited higher levels of illness behavior and emotional distress were more likely to report that their children had frequent pain complaints.
OBJECTIVE  				The aim of the second study was to assess whether children of patients with chronic pain were perceived by their parents to have more pain and illness behavior than children of non-pain parents.
METHODS    				In the first study, forty-two primary caregivers in families with a parent with chronic pain completed questionnaires regarding their children's pain and illness behavior.
METHODS    				In the second study, report of somatic complaints in children of chronic pain parents was compared to complaints in fifty-five children of parents without chronic pain.
RESULTS    				Results of the first study showed that frequently reported pain in the child was associated with significantly higher levels of parent disability, pain behavior and emotional distress.
RESULTS    				Results of the second study showed that children of patients with chronic pain were reported to have more frequent abdominal pain and to use more medication than children of parents without pain.
CONCLUSIONS				The findings of these studies suggest that children of parents with chronic pain may be at risk for illness behavior, especially when the parents exhibit emotional reactions to their pain.

#### Paramenstrual aggression in mentally retarded adult ameliorated by buspirone.

OBJECTIVE  				This case examined the efficacy of buspirone therapy as a reductive technique for severe treatment resistant paramenstrual aggression.
METHODS    				Aggressive outbursts of an institutionalized mentally retarded adult were analyzed and correlated with menstrual cycling.
METHODS    				Behavior was closely monitored, and after ineffective trials of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and beta blockers, a trial of buspirone was initiated.
RESULTS    				Buspirone therapy resulted in a marked decrease in aggressive incidences, and substantial increases in desirable behaviors.
RESULTS    				As a result of the subjects improvement, doses of concurrent psychotropic medications were reduced or discontinued altogether.
CONCLUSIONS				The authors conclude that buspirone is an effective pharmacotherapy for paramenstrual aggression in the developmentally disabled, and encourage similar experimentation when behavior seems to be otherwise untreatable.

#### A review of the postconcussion syndrome.

OBJECTIVE  				This review will focus on aspects of the postconcussion syndrome (PCS), including accompanying symptomatology, neuropsychological changes, brain imaging studies and treatment.
METHODS    				In each topic area, those research studies resulting in the most interpretable data are reported.
METHODS    				Since there is little research in some aspects of the PCS, some studies of limited merit are described, with their limitations outlined, in lieu of not reporting any study.
METHODS    				The section on psychopharmacology largely consists of opinions of recognized clinicians, since there is almost no research on the psychopharmacology of PCS.
RESULTS    				Mild traumatic brain injury is a relatively frequent occurrence which often results in the postconcussion syndrome (PCS), consisting of complaints of irritability, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and memory problems.
RESULTS    				Anxiety and depression are also frequently present, especially later in its course.
RESULTS    				Although the PCS has often been thought to reflect a psychological response to injury, there is considerable recent evidence to suggest that it is primarily a physiologic disturbance.
RESULTS    				For most individuals, treatment consists primarily of education of the patient and his/her family, along with supportive counseling regarding emerging problems at work or at home.
RESULTS    				A subgroup of patients, however, may require psychopharmacologic intervention.
CONCLUSIONS				More research is needed in all aspects of PCS, especially its neurophysiology and pharmacologic treatment.
CONCLUSIONS				Relationships between neurophysiological changes and behavioral and neuropsychological changes are unknown.
CONCLUSIONS				New imaging techniques, such as single-photon emission tomography, and positron emission tomography will likely play an important role in understanding the physiology of this disorder.

#### [Chronotropic changes and cardiac arrhythmias during anesthetic induction and intubation in patients undergoing heart surgery. Study of 79 patients using Holter monitoring].

OBJECTIVE  				To assess changes in heart rate and cardiac arrhythmias during anaesthetic induction and tracheal intubation in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
METHODS    				79 patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were divided into three groups: group I, 36 valvular diseases with a good ventricular function, group II, 22 valvular diseases with an ejection fraction less than 0.5, and group III, included 21 patients with coronary artery disease.
METHODS    				All patients had a Holter monitoring.
METHODS    				Anesthesia was performed with diazepam and morphine in patients with valvular disease and with diazepam and fentanyl in those with coronary artery disease.
RESULTS    				During anesthesia induction there were no significant increases in heart rate in the two groups of patients with valvular diseases: in group I (n = 36, with good ventricular function) heart rate increased by about 5.4 +/- 23% and in group II (n = 22, with ejection fraction less than 0.5) by 7.5 +/- 33%.
RESULTS    				In patients with coronary artery disease (n = 21) we did not observe significant decreases in heart rate (-4.28 +/- 17%).
RESULTS    				During tracheal intubation the heart rate increased by 15.9 +/- 30% in group I (p < 0.002), by 13.6 +/- 30% in group II (p < 0.02), but decreased by 1.19 +/- 23% (p = NS) in patients with coronary artery disease.
RESULTS    				During anesthetic induction we observed frequent premature beats (single forms) in 13.8% of patients in group I, 13.6% in group II, and 9.5% in group III.
RESULTS    				The incidence of this arrhythmia during tracheal intubation was 16.6%, 9%, and 14%, respectively for the three groups.
RESULTS    				Sustained ventricular tachycardia was only observed in one patient.
CONCLUSIONS				Changes in heart rate and ventricular arrhythmias occurring during anesthetic induction and tracheal intubation in patients undergoing valvular and coronary surgery were infrequent and not severe.

#### [Design of an expert system for decision-making in an emergency situation].

OBJECTIVE  				To study the clinical applicability of the expert system URGSANT as a help in making up decisions in emergencies.
METHODS    				URGSANT is an expert system implemented in INSIGT 2+ which is structured in a modular and hierarchical form.
METHODS    				It contemplates 44 urgent situations relating to the central nervous system, hematopoietic, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrinological, and miscellaneous group.
METHODS    				Validation of the program was made by four anesthesiologists who evaluated the performance of the program in 25 emergency cases and in 25 other situations that were treated by other specialists.
RESULTS    				The rationale of the system was basically correct.
RESULTS    				In most cases the program was considered efficient or very efficient during the different clinical situations and only in one case its guidance was wrong.
CONCLUSIONS				The URGSANT expert system is an efficient and useful method for the clinician during emergency situations.

#### [Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. I. Clinico-biological features of 307 cases].

OBJECTIVE  				To assess the clinico-biological features appearing in 307 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL).
METHODS    				The clinical records of 338 patients diagnosed of NHL between January 1975 and December 1988 were revised in retrospect.
METHODS    				All cases with histologic diagnosis of NHL aged over 14 years were included, and classified in accordance with the Working Formulation criteria.
METHODS    				The following data were analysed: age, sex, first complaints, time elapsed since onset, histologic type, number of sites involved, bulky disease, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, LDH, stage, type of treatment and initial response, survival, and cause of death.
METHODS    				The statistical evaluation was performed by actuarial analysis (Kaplan and Meier) and comparison (log-rank test) of survival.
RESULTS    				According to the three categories of the malignancies, the NHL were distributed into low-grade (37.8%), intermediate (36.1%) and high-grade (26.9%).
RESULTS    				The mean age of the series was 56.6 years and the M/F ratio was 1.3.
RESULTS    				Lymph node enlargement was the commonest finding; 36.4% of the patients had symptoms related with the disease, and 26.7% had bulky disease.
RESULTS    				Anaemia was present in 37.7% of the cases and thrombocytopenia in 14.3%, with similar distribution among the three grades.
RESULTS    				High LDH levels were found in 44% of the patients.
RESULTS    				At diagnosis, 85% of the patients were in advanced stages (III+IV) already.
RESULTS    				Complete response was attained in 51.1% of the cases, with median survival of 48 months.
CONCLUSIONS				The clinico-evolutive data found here are similar to other reports in the literature.
CONCLUSIONS				In one-half of the patients the cause of the first visit is lymph node enlargement.
CONCLUSIONS				Complete remission is achieved by one out of two patients, this figure being similar for each of the histologic groups.
CONCLUSIONS				The Working Formulation is useful in determining the different prognostic groups with respect to survival.

#### [Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. II. Analysis of the prognostic factors in a series of 307 patients].

OBJECTIVE  				To analyse different clinico-biologic data in order to assess their prognostic value in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients.
METHODS    				The series comprises 307 patients with NHL diagnosed and treated between 1975 and 1988.
METHODS    				The histopathologic diagnosis was revised in accordance with the working formulation system, three prognostic groups being thus considered: low-grade (LGL), intermediate-grade (IGL) and high-grade (HGL) lymphomas.
METHODS    				Age, sex, clinical course prior to diagnosis, presence of B symptoms, histologic type, number of lymph-node areas involved, bulky disease, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, LDH, stage and response to therapy were all evaluated for the study.
METHODS    				Survival curves were drawn with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test was used for comparison of median survival.
METHODS    				Whenever the univariate analysis achieved statistical significance, a multivariate analysis was performed by means of a multiple correlation and regression study in accordance with the Cox's model, in which the variables were expressed in a binary model.
RESULTS    				The following 8 values were found significant in the univariate study of low-grade lymphomas: age, number of involved areas, bulky disease anaemia, thrombocytopenia, LDH, stage, and initial response to treatment.
RESULTS    				In intermediate-grade lymphomas, the significant findings were age, number of affected areas, bulky disease, thrombocytopenia, LDH, stage, and initial response.
RESULTS    				For high-grade lymphomas, number of affected areas, thrombocytopenia, LDH, stage and initial response were found statistically significant.
RESULTS    				Although no significant differences were found for survival within each of the three grades, such differences were significant between them.
RESULTS    				In the multivariate analysis, age was significant only in the LGL (p < 0.0001) in IGL, age (p < 0.07) and initial response to therapy (p < 0.0001) achieved significant value, and in HGL, stage (p < 0.02) and initial response to treatment (p < 0.0001) attained significance.
CONCLUSIONS				The univariate analysis provides various prognostic factors of statistically significance, as reported in the literature, but these after the multivariate analysis was applied, were reduced to age, stage and initial response to treatment.

#### [Features of chronic myeloid leukemia at diagnosis. Study of a series of 134 cases].

OBJECTIVE  				To analyse the clinico-biological features of 134 patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) at presentation.
METHODS    				The series is comprised of 134 patients from the Asturias Central Hospital and other hospital of the region, diagnosed of CML with conventional criteria between 1970 and 1989.
METHODS    				A retrospective study was carried out revising the clinical records and the clinico-biological data at diagnosis.
METHODS    				Cytogenetic studies were available in 62 cases.
METHODS    				The statistical analysis was based upon descriptive statistics and comparison of means and proportions by the chi square and Student's tests.
METHODS    				Univariate study was also performed for several variables.
RESULTS    				The mean age of the group was 50 years, ranging between 2 and 81.
RESULTS    				The M/F ratio was 76/58.
RESULTS    				The commonest symptoms at onset were those secondary to hypermetabolism and splenomegaly, 8% of the patients being asymptomatic.
RESULTS    				Splenomegaly was present in 73.8% of the patients and hepatomegaly in 37.6%.
RESULTS    				The median white cell count was 132 x 10(9)/L. Absolute basophilia and eosinophilia were seen in 83% and 78% of the cases, respectively.
RESULTS    				Anaemia was found in 47.4% of the patients, usually mild, and 39% of them had nucleated red cells in peripheral blood.
RESULTS    				The median platelet count was 400 x 10(9)/L. Thrombocytosis was found in 48% of the cases, while 11% had thrombocytopenia.
RESULTS    				The mean number of blast cells in the bone marrow was 1.72%.
RESULTS    				The histopathologic study of the bone marrow revealed decreased red cells in 94.5% of the patients and decreased megakaryocytes in 29.5%; these last were increased in 50% of the patients.
RESULTS    				Increased reticulin fibres were found in 38.5% of the bone marrow samples.
RESULTS    				In addition to the Ph' chromosome, which was present in 51 patients, chromosomal abnormalities were seen in 15.6% of the cases in the chronic phase and in 69.2% in the terminal stages of the disease.
RESULTS    				Positive correlation could be established between the white cell count and the size of spleen (p < 0.001) and liver (p < 0.05), and there was a negative correlation between white blood cell count and haemoglobin rate and platelet count (p < 0.05 for both).
CONCLUSIONS				(1) The analysis of this series shows that the CML cases in this region have similar characteristics to those in other western world communities (2).
CONCLUSIONS				The mean age of this group is somewhat higher than in other series, which should be re-evaluated after discarding the Ph'-negative cases. (
CONCLUSIONS				3) There seems to be positive correlation between leucocyte count and spleen and liver enlargement, and negative correlation between leucocyte count and haemoglobin and platelet count.
