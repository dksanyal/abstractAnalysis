#### [Electron microscopic study on the "ghost bodies" in experimental arteriosclerotic lesions of the vascular wall (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				Details on the origin and the pathogenesis of the so-called "ghost bodies" occurring in the arteries and arterioles following experimental lesions of the vascular wall were to be studied under peculiar experimental conditions (immunological injury and cholesterol diet in combination).
METHODS    				The experiments were carried out on 26 young rabbits of the same race and equal sex.
METHODS    				They were selected from several test groups with experimentally induced arteriosclerosis.
METHODS    				For challenge of immunological injury the animals were administered 3 intracutaneous injections of each 3 ml of horse serum at intervals of one week.
METHODS    				Afterwards they received one or two intravenous injections of 2-3 ml of horse serum at weekly intervals.
METHODS    				Immediately after the last injection the animals were sacrificed.
METHODS    				A series of the animals were fed a cholesterol diet for some weeks after previous immunological injury (for details see WEIDENBACH and MASSMANN 1972).
METHODS    				From a total of 26 animals always several sections of the aorta were investigated.
METHODS    				5 animals were used for controls.
METHODS    				After decapitation of the animals the aortas were removed immediately and fixed in 2.5-3% glutaraldehyde for 2 hours.
METHODS    				Afterwards they were postfixed in 1% osmium-Millonig solution for 1 hour.
METHODS    				After 15 min the tissue samples were washed in Tyrode solution for 15 min, dehydrated in ascendent aceton grades and contrasted in blocks in the stage of 70% aceton.
METHODS    				After embedding in Micropal the material was sectioned by an ultramicrotome OmU2 (Fa, Reichert, Wien) and investigated in electron microscopes of the types SEM 2-3 (100 kV) or KEM 1-2 (60 kV) (VEB Werk für Fernsehelektronik Berlin-Oberschöneweide).
RESULTS    				Basing on their observations the authors classify as ghost bodies all cytoplasmic protrusions and all constricted extracellular structures which are limited by a membrane and filled with prevailingly filamentous-granular material (figs.
RESULTS    				1, 2, 3), occasionaly also including fragments of cell organelles (fig.
RESULTS    				4).
RESULTS    				They develop from cytoplasmic protrusions or bulgings of the processes of smooth muscle cells (figs.
RESULTS    				1 and 2).
RESULTS    				In these protrusions the cytoplasm of the smooth muscle cells is loosened and of filamentous-granular appearance (fig.
RESULTS    				1).
RESULTS    				The cells themselves show all characteristics of a modified or activated smooth muscle cell: they are branched, the organelles display marked secretory-metabolic activity associated with partical loss of the contractile elements whereas degenerative changes of these cells are nearly completely absent.
RESULTS    				Frequently focal disorganization of the cell membrane with release of the content to extracellular regions can be observed which is locally associated with the development of fibrillar structures.--In the environment of the "ghost bodies" the formation of collagenous fibres is visible (fig.
RESULTS    				3).
RESULTS    				Degenerative changes which point to transition to necrosis can only occasionally be observed...

#### [Sephadex induced inflammation in rats (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				A single s.c.
OBJECTIVE  				injection of Dextran is very suitable in producing an inflammatory response in the rat.
OBJECTIVE  				The Dextran edema has become a standard method.
OBJECTIVE  				It seems not uhlikely that Sephadex, the Dextran gel widely used in the gelchromatography may have a similar effect.
OBJECTIVE  				Sephadex, because of its physiochemical properties, would offer some advantages in the studies of inflammatory reactions.
OBJECTIVE  				But first of all the following questions have to be answered: 1.
OBJECTIVE  				Does one single s.c.
OBJECTIVE  				injection of Sephadex produce an inflammation at all and what are the characteristics on the microscopical level?
OBJECTIVE  				2 Does it make any difference if Sephadex of different types are injected?
METHODS    				Male and female Wistar rats (100-250 g) in groups of 5 animals each.
METHODS    				Diet: Rat pellets "Tagger" and tap water ad libitum.
METHODS    				Sephadex (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals) of the types G-25 m, G-50 m, G-100, and G-200 were soaked in 0.9% saline for the prescribed time and afterwards preserved until the Sephadex gel had settled on the bottom of the vessels.
METHODS    				1 ml of this Sephadex gel slurry each were subcutaneously injected to the shaved dorsal skin of the rats (right below).
METHODS    				At different intervals (3, 6, 24 and 72 hours: 6, 14, 20 and 28 days) the Sephadex depot and the surrounding tissue were exstirpated and examined histologically.
METHODS    				During all the procedures the animals were subjected to ether anesthesia.
METHODS    				From the tissue samples frozen sections (Kryocut, -30 degrees C) were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin or after van Gieson.
METHODS    				Moreover, several preparations were stained after Pappenheim and Weigert (fibrin) or with PAS and toluidine blue.
METHODS    				For recording of probable differences in the effect of the particular Sephadex types always 2 values were determined histometrically.
METHODS    				The number of exudate cells emigrated between the Sephadex beads within the area of an ocular-net (edge length 1.66 mm) were counted at 500-fold magnification.
METHODS    				Furthermore, the number of eosinophils was determined by the technique.
METHODS    				However, because of poor occurrence the eosinophils were counted in 10 fields of view.
METHODS    				Tests with Sephadex G-10 were omitted as preliminary tests had shown that it is not suitable for s.c.
METHODS    				injections because of its gritty consistency (due to poor soaking properties).
RESULTS    				One single s.c.
RESULTS    				injection of Sephadex in the rat induces an acute inflammation.
RESULTS    				The exudative phase marked by a massive leucocytic infiltration (especially PMN leucocytes) is followed by the appearance of mononuclear leucocytes and fibroblasts after the 2nd day.
RESULTS    				The inflammation declines within approximately 3 weeks.
RESULTS    				Thereafter the Sephadex depot is encapsulated by a fibrous tissue.
RESULTS    				A chronic inflammation was never observed.
RESULTS    				In the microscopical aspect of the inflammation produced by the different types of Sephadex were detectable.
RESULTS    				The Sephadex lying in the tissue does not change its original shape, it is insoluble and is not disintegrated.
RESULTS    				The size of the particles prevents the transport into the blood or lymph vessels...

#### [Histological studies on the antiphlogistic effects caused by natural antiinflammatory factors (author's transl)].

OBJECTIVE  				The dextran gel Sephadex causes a marked inflammatory response in rats when injected subcutaneously.
OBJECTIVE  				This effect was used as a model of experimental inflammation.
OBJECTIVE  				Sephadex and the resulting inflammatory exudate were gained and used again to study their antiphlogistic effects in the identical model.
OBJECTIVE  				Histological reactions of the Sephadex induced acute inflammation were analyzed with and without presence of the exudate.
METHODS    				Male and female Wistar rats (100-250 g).
METHODS    				Sephadex  G-200 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals).
METHODS    				Sephadex B-200 (1 ml, swollen in 0.9% NaCl) was injected subcutaneously in the control group (C), whereas the experimental groups were injected with either untreated Sephadex taken from 1,3 and 5 days old inflammatory deposits (group A) or with Sephadex, extracted from those deposits but subsequently washed free by 0.9% NaCl (group B).
METHODS    				Only the inner and not yet organized part of the Sephadex deposit was used in both experimental groups.
METHODS    				In group A, B and C the histological effects were examined 24h after injection.
METHODS    				The number of eosinophils amongst the exudate cells was counted.
METHODS    				100 mast cells of the perifocal region were examined in order to measure the percentage of degranulated cells.
METHODS    				A smear differential count was performed using subepidermic parts of the Sephadex deposit.
RESULTS    				Sephadex injection caused a very marked inflammatory reaction which was studied extensively.
RESULTS    				Similar results were obtained either using fresh Sephadex or washed Sephadex from inflammatory deposits.
RESULTS    				However, Sephadex from inflammatory deposits without wash induced only mild inflammatory reactions.
RESULTS    				All signs of acute inflammation were less pronounced.
RESULTS    				Hence, the phlogistic efficacy of Sephadex is reduced by the simultaneous presence of exudate.
RESULTS    				The most significant antiphlogistic effects were seen when exudate containing Sephadex  from 3 days old inflammatory deposits was used.
RESULTS    				The significance of soluble parts of the exudate in these antiphlogistic effects is discussed.

#### [Influence of industrialization on trace element concentration in human lungs].

BACKGROUND 				People who spend their entire lives in highly industrialized regions are in danger of accumulating trace elements by inhalation as a result of the increased amounts of factory-produced smoke.
BACKGROUND 				In order to test the environmentally accumulated trace elements in lungs, lung samples of patients who lived their entire lives in the industrial area of Duisburg were compared with those of patients from the less industrialized areas of Cologne and surroundings.
METHODS    				Five patients were studied who lived in Duisburg and died at 50-68 years but not primarily as a result of lung diseases.
METHODS    				From each patient five samples of the left lung were removed at autopsy.
METHODS    				Lungs from 18 patients who died in Cologne were also examined.
METHODS    				From each of the latter 2 samples were removed from the left lung.
METHODS    				All samples were studied by means of neutron activation analysis and the following elements analysed: Co, Fe, Rb, Se, Cr, Cs, Sb, Sc, Zn and Al.
METHODS    				The Al-concentration was analysed only in patients aged 50-68 years.
RESULTS    				The values of the non-essential Sc, Al and Cs and of the essential trace elements Co were found to be appreciably higher in the samples from Duisburg than in those from Cologne.
RESULTS    				Sc in the samples from the highly industrialized area was increased up to a factor of 100, Cs, Al and Co to a factor of 10.
RESULTS    				In the lungs of adults in Duisburg, aged 50-68 years, the concentration of Sc was more than 1,000 times greater than in lungs of children in Cologne, aged 0-10 years.
RESULTS    				In all samples from Duisburg, the rare element Eu was detectable by means of neutron activation analysis but could  not be detected in a sample from Cologne.
CONCLUSIONS				It is likely that the different uptakes of trace elements in the lungs depend on correspondingly different concentrations of the elements in the air.
CONCLUSIONS				The extensive accumulation, especially of the non-essential elements, in the lungs should be an incentive to examine possible detrimental effects on human health in the future.
CONCLUSIONS				The element Sc which was strikingly accumulated in the lungs and which can be easily measured by neutron activation analysis might be used as a standard for estimating the extent of environmental pollution.

#### [Reversible hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the mouse liver induced by a functional charge with phenobarbital].

BACKGROUND 				Administration of phenobarbital to rats and mice is well known to cause enlargement of the liver, where the drug is metabolized by hydroxylation and oxydation.
BACKGROUND 				The increase of the liver weight is thought to be due to and enlargement of the individual hepatocytes (hypertrophy) caused by an augmentation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, as well as to cell multiplication (hyperplasia).
BACKGROUND 				The present investigation  deals with the nuclear DNA content of mouse hepatocytes during and after administration of different doses of phenobarbital.
BACKGROUND 				The data are related to liver weight with due consideration of mitotic activity and cell loss by necrobiosis.
METHODS    				172 five to six weeks old male albino NMRI mice with a body weight of 23 to 33 gms were randomly divided into four groups, one of which served as the controls.
METHODS    				The three test groups received 75 mg and 150 mg phenobarbital per 1 kg body weight intraperitoneally once every day for a total of 10 days.
METHODS    				Thereafter the administration of the drug was discontinued.
METHODS    				Beginning with the third day of the experiment 3 animals of each group were sacrificed by exsanguination every secound day after their body weight had been carefully determined.
METHODS    				Then the liver weights were measured.
METHODS    				The nuclear DNA content of the hepatocytes was determined from liver smears by means of acriflavine-Feulgen fluorescence cytophotometry.
METHODS    				The number of mitotic figures and of necrobiotic liver cells was counted in histologic sections.
RESULTS    				With animals receiving 150 mg and 100 mg phenobarbital per 1 kg body weight a rapid increase of the relative liver weight (up to 74% above the controls) was observed, which was reduced back to normal levels within 10 days after discontinuation of the drug.
RESULTS    				Parallel with the increase of the liver weight a striking DNA-polyploidisation of the liver nuclei occurred which proved to be reversible during the reduction phase.
RESULTS    				Mitotic figures were found only in the initial phase of the experiment (third to fifth day), while the number of necrobiotic hepatocytes was increased after the drug was discontinued.
RESULTS    				Similar but markedly less pronounced effects were encountered with animals of the 75 group.
CONCLUSIONS				It is concluded that the increase of the liver weight of mice after phenobarbital administration is partly due to cell multiplication (hyperplasia) - as is shown by a high number of mitotic figures in the initial phase of the experiment-, partly due to the enlargement of hepatocytes with concommitant polyploidisation of the muclei (hypertrophy).
CONCLUSIONS				When the drug administration is discontinued the liver weights return to normal levels within 10 days.
CONCLUSIONS				Since at the same time the number of high-ploidy nuclei is reduced with no evidence of an increased mitotic activity, the reduction of the liver weight should be partly caused by an elimination of high-ploidy hepatocytes, which are no longer required after the hyperfunctional stimulus has ceased...

#### Role of the SIKVAV site of laminin in promotion of angiogenesis and tumor growth: an in vivo Matrigel model.

BACKGROUND 				Angiogenesis (vascularization) has a critical role in tumor growth and metastasis, and peptides containing the SIKVAV amino acid sequence (Ser-Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val) have been shown to stimulate many angiogenic activities in vitro.
BACKGROUND 				The use of model systems to identify agents that stimulate or inhibit angiogenesis may lead to the development of new antitumor strategies.
OBJECTIVE  				Our purpose was to use an in vivo murine model system to study the angiogenic activity of a synthetic peptide derived from the laminin A protein chain and containing the SIKVAV amino acid sequence.
OBJECTIVE  				We also examined the ability of the peptide to enhance tumor growth in vivo.
METHODS    				The SIKVAV-containing peptide was mixed with Matrigel, a reconstituted basement membrane extract used to assay stimulation of angiogenesis.
METHODS    				The mixture was subcutaneously injected into C57BL/6 mice.
METHODS    				At various times after injection, the Matrigel plug was excised, and angiogenic activity was assessed by histologic examination and immunohistochemical staining with an antibody to the von Willebrand factor (vWF), an endothelium-specific antigen.
METHODS    				In other experiments, the mixture of peptide and Matrigel was co-injected with B16F10 murine melanoma cells into C57BL/6 mice, and the resultant tumors were assessed for size and vascularization.
RESULTS    				When co-injected with Matrigel at doses as low as 10 micrograms, the SIKVAV-containing peptide stimulated angiogenesis fourfold greater than that seen in controls, and maximum angiogenic activity was observed 2 weeks after injection.
RESULTS    				This peptide was angiogenic in a dose-dependent manner up to a 100-micrograms dose.
RESULTS    				When co-injected with Matrigel and B16F10 melanoma cells, the peptide enhanced tumor growth by approximately 2.5-fold, and tumor vascularization was significantly increased (P = .027) over that observed after injection with melanoma cells and Matrigel alone.
CONCLUSIONS				These data demonstrate that the laminin-derived SIKVAV-containing peptide is angiogenic in a new in vivo model system and can enhance tumor vascularization and growth.

#### Mutations of p53 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma: roles of hepatitis B virus and aflatoxin contamination in the diet.

BACKGROUND 				Mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene have been reported in 50% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from China and South Africa.
BACKGROUND 				These reports suggested an association of p53 mutations with high levels of aflatoxin in the diet.
BACKGROUND 				Most studies of p53 and HCC, however, have not fully evaluated the possible role of the hepatitis B virus (HBV).
BACKGROUND 				Aflatoxin is a substance produced by food mold that is known to cause HCC in experimental animals.
OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship of p53 gene mutation to high or low levels of aflatoxin in the diet and to HBV infection.
METHODS    				p53 protein and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) were evaluated by immunohistochemistry using the avidin-biotin-peroxidase system in paraffin-embedded specimens of HCC and of adjacent nontumorous liver tissue from 43 patients.
METHODS    				Tissue specimens from three normal human livers were also evaluated.
METHODS    				HCCs and adjacent nontumorous liver tissues were obtained from 23 patients from Qidong, China, where aflatoxin levels in the diet are high, and from 20 patients from two regions in the United States (patients from the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md., and Kuakini Medical Center, Honolulu, Hawaii), where aflatoxin levels in the diet are low.
RESULTS    				Mutant p53 protein was detected in the nuclei of HCCs from 14 (61%) of 23 patients from China and from three (30%) of 10 patients and six (60%) of 10 patients, respectively, from the two regions of the United States.
RESULTS    				A statistically significant association between detection of mutant p53 protein in HCC cells and the detection of HBsAg in hepatocytes of the adjacent nontumorous liver tissue was observed in patients from China and the United States considered together.
CONCLUSIONS				Mutations of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in hepatocellular carcinomas are not limited to patients from geographic regions where the ingestion of aflatoxin is high.
CONCLUSIONS				In many patients, these mutations may be associated with HBV infection.
CONCLUSIONS				The possible interaction of chronic HBV infection and p53 gene mutation, suggested by these data, indicates a mechanism by which HBV infection beginning early in life could contribute to the subsequent development of HCC.

#### Inhibition by pentosan polysulfate (PPS) of heparin-binding growth factors released from tumor cells and blockage by PPS of tumor growth in animals.

BACKGROUND 				In a proliferating tumor, locally secreted polypeptide growth factors, which have autocrine and paracrine functions, induce vascularization essential for tumor growth and metastasis.
BACKGROUND 				These growth factors may serve as targets for tumor therapy.
BACKGROUND 				We have shown that the heparinoid pentosan polysulfate (PPS) can block growth of subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude mice and angiogenesis induced by the heparin-binding, Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF).
OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of this study was to determine whether PPS might also interfere with stimulation of endothelial cells by other growth factors released from tumor cells and whether the promising antitumor effects of PPS extend to other human tumor cell lines.
OBJECTIVE  				We studied the effects of PPS on stimulation by heparin-binding growth factors released from seven human tumor cell lines in vitro and on tumors growing from these cell lines in athymic nude mice.
METHODS    				Seven human cell lines established from breast, prostate, epidermoid, and lung carcinomas and rhabdomyosarcoma were used in in vivo as well as in vitro studies of the effects of PPS.
METHODS    				We also studied in vitro the effects of PPS on growth factor-induced colony formation of normal rat kidney fibroblasts and human adrenal carcinoma cells.
RESULTS    				The tumor cell lines released growth factors into their media that stimulated growth of endothelial and epithelial cells as well as fibroblasts.
RESULTS    				Heparin-affinity chromatography showed that heparin-binding growth factors contributed substantially to this paracrine activity and that PPS inhibited this stimulus.
RESULTS    				Six of the seven tumor cell lines were resistant to PPS in soft-agar cloning assays and hence did not appear to depend on autocrine stimulation by the heparin-binding growth factors.
RESULTS    				In contrast to this in vitro resistance, subcutaneous growth of tumors from all cell lines in athymic nude mice was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by daily intraperitoneal injections of PPS.
CONCLUSIONS				We conclude that heparin-binding growth factors contribute substantially to tumor growth in vivo and that PPS acts by blocking the paracrine effects of heparin-binding growth factors released from the tumor cells.
CONCLUSIONS				PPS could become a novel treatment tool targeting tumor growth factors.

#### Growth inhibition with reversible cell cycle arrest of carcinoma cells by flavone L86-8275.

BACKGROUND 				Previous studies have shown that polyhydroxylated flavonoids such as quercetin and genistein can inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro, and preliminary in vivo studies of the flavone L86-8275 have shown growth inhibition of LX529 and A549 lung carcinomas.
BACKGROUND 				L86-8275 [(-)cis-5,7-dihydroxy-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-8[4-(3-hydroxy-1-methyl)- piperidinyl]-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one] is a flavone of novel structure.
OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of this study was to determine in vitro whether L86-8275 is a more potent inhibitor of growth in breast carcinoma and lung carcinoma cells than quercetin or genistein.
METHODS    				We studied the effects of L86-8275 on cell growth in seven breast carcinoma cell lines and five lung carcinoma cell lines.
METHODS    				MDA468 breast carcinoma was then selected for further study.
METHODS    				Cell proliferation was measured by a colorimetric dye reduction assay; synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein by incorporation of the radioactive metabolic precursors thymidine, uridine, or leucine, respectively; adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content by a luciferase-mediated bioluminescence reaction; and cell cycle progression by the use of cell-synchronizing drugs (aphidicolin and nocodazole) and flow cytometry.
RESULTS    				L86-8275 was not cytotoxic to stationary-phase cells but reversibly inhibited the growth of cells in exponential growth phase.
RESULTS    				At concentrations of 25-160 nM, L86-8275 inhibited growth of human breast and lung carcinoma cell lines by 50%.
RESULTS    				MDA468 breast carcinoma cells were 60-fold and 400-fold more sensitive to L86-8275 than to quercetin and genistein, respectively.
RESULTS    				By 24 hours after addition of L86-8275, DNA synthesis in MDA468 cells was inhibited by greater than 95%, protein synthesis by 80%, and RNA synthesis by 40%-60%, under conditions that preserved cellular ATP levels at approximately 80%-90% of control values.
RESULTS    				When MDA468 cells released from aphidicolin-induced cell cycle arrest were exposed to 200 nM L86-8275, they completed the S phase but arrested in G2.
RESULTS    				When cells released from nocodazole-induced cell cycle arrest were exposed to 200 nM L86-8275, they completed mitosis but arrested in G1.
CONCLUSIONS				L86-8275 is a potent, yet reversible, growth-inhibitory flavone that can selectively block cell cycle progression in vitro at more than one point in the cell cycle.
CONCLUSIONS				These findings suggest that L86-8275 is a candidate for further preclinical development, as well as a model for the synthesis of other flavonoids that might potently delay cell cycle progression to achieve inhibition of tumor growth.
CONCLUSIONS				Future studies need to address optimal schedules for antiproliferative activity in vivo and inhibition of clonogenic activity.

#### Expression of acidic fibroblast growth factor in regenerating liver and during hepatic differentiation.

BACKGROUND 				Acidic fibroblast growth factor belongs to a family of growth factors that show a high affinity for heparin sulfate proteoglycans.
BACKGROUND 				In vitro, it participates in various cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, and cell migration, but in vivo, the physiologic role of this growth factor is still not clearly defined.
METHODS    				The level of expression and also cellular distribution of transcripts for acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) were studied in adult rat liver after partial hepatectomy and during hepatic differentiation in fetal, neonatal, and adult livers by Northern analysis and in situ hybridization techniques.
RESULTS    				After partial hepatectomy a significant increase in the transcripts for aFGF was observed at 24 hours, whereas at 4 and 12 hours after the operation, the level of transcripts were similar to those of sham-operated animals.
RESULTS    				In the postnatal liver a high level of aFGF expression was present when the most evident transition from 2 to 3 cell thick hepatic cords to normal hepatic structure is taking place (Ogawa K, Medine A, Farber E. Br J Cancer 1979;40: 782-90).
RESULTS    				In contrast during the prenatal period, when the liver is still a hemopoietic organ and only a small number of sinusoids are present, low level of aFGF transcripts could be found.
RESULTS    				Animals treated with 2-acetylaminofluorene and partial hepatectomy (Evarts RP, Nagy P, Marsden E, Thorgeirsson SS.
RESULTS    				Carcinogenesis 1987;8:1737-40) displayed a marked increase in hepatic aFGF transcripts at the peak of proliferation of primitive liver epithelial cells (oval cells) and perisinusoidal stellate cells (Ito cells) in addition to hepatocytes.
RESULTS    				In situ hybridization combined with immunocytochemistry using oval and Ito cell specific antibodies revealed the presence of transcripts both in oval cells and Ito cells.
RESULTS    				Basophilic areas composed of small hepatocytes had a 3-fold increase in the level of transcripts as compared with the surrounding hepatocytes.
CONCLUSIONS				These experiments demonstrate that the expression of aFGF is highest during the late stages of hepatic morphogenesis in newborn animals as well as during hepatic differentiation in adult liver.

#### Markers of complement-dependent and complement-independent glomerular visceral epithelial cell injury in vivo. Expression of antiadhesive proteins and cytoskeletal changes.

BACKGROUND 				Visceral glomerular epithelial cells (GEC) are an important component of the glomerular filtration barrier to proteins.
BACKGROUND 				While ultrastructural GEC changes have frequently been observed in proteinuric states, no suitable light microscopic markers of GEC injury have yet been identified.
METHODS    				We have analyzed in vivo the GEC expression of proteins known to be involved in cell shape changes.
METHODS    				SPARC (osteonectin, BM-40) and tenascin (cytotactin, J1, hexabrachion) belong to a group of anti-adhesive glycoproteins, that modulate cell-matrix interactions.
METHODS    				We also studied cytoskeletal intermediate filament proteins, including desmin and vimentin.
METHODS    				The GEC expression of SPARC, tenascin, desmin, and vimentin was analyzed in various types of GEC injury in the rat, including complement-mediated injury (passive Heymann nephritis, autologous immune complex nephritis, conA anti-conA nephritis), complement-independent injury (nephrotoxic nephritis), toxic injury (aminonucleoside nephrosis) and hypertensive injury (5/6 nephrectomy, angiotensin-II infusion).
METHODS    				A complement-mediated model of mesangial cell injury (anti-Thy 1.1 mesangial proliferative nephritis) served as a control.
RESULTS    				SPARC mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed in normal rat glomeruli.
RESULTS    				Immunostaining and immunoelectron microscopy primarily localized SPARC to the cytoplasm of GEC.
RESULTS    				Markedly increased glomerular SPARC synthesis and GEC immunostaining was observed in all instances of complement-mediated GEC injury but in none of the other conditions.
RESULTS    				In contrast, glomerular immunostaining for tenascin, that also stained in a GEC pattern, either remained unchanged or increased to a minor degree (complement-mediated models).
RESULTS    				GEC immunostaining for desmin in normal rats was low and variable, and increased significantly in any form of GEC injury but not in anti-Thy 1.1 nephritis.
RESULTS    				No concomitant increase of GEC immunostaining for vimentin was detectable, which could have been due to the constitutively high expression of vimentin in GEC.
CONCLUSIONS				SPARC and desmin, but not tenascin or vimentin, are suitable light microscopic markers of GEC injury.
CONCLUSIONS				The combined staining for these proteins may be useful in differentiating the mechanisms of GEC injury.

#### A simple, quantitative method for assessing angiogenesis and antiangiogenic agents using reconstituted basement membrane, heparin, and fibroblast growth factor.

BACKGROUND 				Blood vessel growth is necessary for normal tissue homeostatis and contributes to solid tumor growth.
BACKGROUND 				Methods to quantitate neovascularization should be useful in testing biological factors and drugs that regulate angiogenesis or to induce a vascular supply to promote wound healing.
METHODS    				An extract of basement membrane proteins (Matrigel) was found to reconstitute into a gel when injected subcutaneously into C57/BL mice and to support an intense vascular response when supplemented with angiogenic factors.
RESULTS    				New vessels and von Willebrand factor antigen staining were apparent in the gel 2-3 days after injection, reaching a maximum after 3-5 days.
RESULTS    				Hemoglobin content of the gels was found to parallel the increase in vessels in the gel allowing ready quantitation.
RESULTS    				Angiogenesis was obtained with both acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and was enhanced by heparin.
RESULTS    				Several substances were tested for angiostatic activity in this assay by coinjection in Matrigel with fibroblast growth factor and heparin.
RESULTS    				Platelet-derived growth factor BB, interleukin 1-beta, interleukin-6, and transforming growth factor-beta were potent inhibitors of neovascularization induced by fibroblast growth factor.
RESULTS    				Tumor necrosis factor-alpha did not alter the response but was alone a potent inducer of neovascularization when coinjected with Matrigel and heparin.
RESULTS    				Consistent with the previously demonstrated importance of collagenase in mediating endothelial cell invasion, a tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases that also inhibits collagenases was found to be a potent inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor-induced angiogenesis.
CONCLUSIONS				Our assay allows the ready quantitative assessment of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors and should be useful in the isolation of endothelial cells from the capillaries that penetrate into the gel.

#### Pathways of macromolecular tracer transport across venules and small veins. Structural basis for the hyperpermeability of tumor blood vessels.

BACKGROUND 				Blood vessels supplying tumors are hyperpermeable to macromolecules, but the mechanisms responsible are poorly understood.
METHODS    				To investigate the structural basis for the leakiness of tumor blood vessels, we performed a transmission electron microscopic study of three syngeneic transplantable carcinomas (mouse ovarian carcinoma and the line 1 and line 10 bile duct guinea pig carcinomas) at early intervals after intravenous injection of several macromolecular tracers.
METHODS    				Tracers with widely differing physical properties were studied: horseradish peroxidase, ferritin, 150 kilodalton fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran and gold-bovine serum albumin.
RESULTS    				All tracers leaked primarily from venules and small veins at the tumor-host interface, for the most part vessels lined by a continuous endothelium.
RESULTS    				The predominant pathway by which all four tracers exited venules in all three tumors was by way of a system of smooth membrane-bound, interconnecting vesicles and vacuoles; these tended to cluster together at irregular intervals in the endothelial cell cytoplasm to form organelle-like structures, vesiculo-vacuolar organelles (VVO).
RESULTS    				In favorable sections, VVO interfaced with both the luminal and abluminal surfaces of endothelial cells.
RESULTS    				HRP alone crossed venules and small veins through apposed inter-endothelial cell junctions.
RESULTS    				Tracers also exited vessels by way of endothelial fenestrae where these occurred (rarely) in mouse ovarian tumor-associated venules.
RESULTS    				VVO occurred with similar frequency and complexity in the continuous endothelium-lined venules and small veins that supplied the normal subcutis of either tumor-bearing or control animals.
RESULTS    				As in tumor-associated vessels, VVO provided the predominant pathway by which all four tracers exited normal vessels, but VVO labeling and extravasation were both much greater in tumor than in control vessels (p < 0.001 for ferritin).
CONCLUSIONS				VVO are prominent structures in both tumor-supplying and control vessel endothelial cells and provide the primary pathway for macromolecular extravasation.
CONCLUSIONS				The large increase in permeability characteristic of tumor vessels is likely attributable to upregulation of VVO function.

#### Loss of expression of protectin (CD59) is associated with complement membrane attack complex deposition in myocardial infarction.

BACKGROUND 				Protectin (CD59) is a recently discovered inhibitor of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC).
BACKGROUND 				In the present study we investigated expression of protectin in human heart and examined the relationship between MAC deposition and protectin in myocardial infarction.
METHODS    				Myocardial tissue specimens were obtained at autopsy from patients who had died of myocardial infarction (n = 10) or other causes (n = 5).
METHODS    				MAC and protectin were detected by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy analysis in the heart sections by using antibodies against individual components of MAC, MAC neoantigens and protectin.
METHODS    				Myocardial protectin was purified by affinity chromatography and compared with the previously characterized erythrocyte and urinary protectins by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and testing its ability to bind to the terminal complement complex.
METHODS    				The possible glycophosphoinositol-type anchorage of protectin in the heart was examined by treating myocardial sections with glycophosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C.
RESULTS    				Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analysis showed expression of protectin in the sarcolemmal membranes of normal myocardium.
RESULTS    				Protectin purified from normal human heart tissue had the same molecular weight and N-terminal amino acid sequence as CD59 purified from urine.
RESULTS    				In sucrose density ultracentrifugation analysis it was observed to bind efficiently to the SC5b-8 complex.
RESULTS    				In normal myocardium the expression of CD59 was sensitive to treatment with glycophosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C. The expression of CD59 was lost or clearly diminished in infarcted lesions aged 1-14 days.
RESULTS    				Loss of CD59 expression was accompanied by concomitant deposition of the MAC within the CD59-negative lesions.
RESULTS    				In border areas between an infarcted lesion and normal tissue, CD59 often appeared in small vesicles, suggesting shedding as a possible mechanism for its removal.
CONCLUSIONS				Glycophosphoinositol-anchored CD59 is expressed in the sarcolemmal membranes of normal heart but lost from infarcted myocardium.
CONCLUSIONS				Acquired loss of resistance to autologous complement and subsequent complement attack may thus be involved in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction.

#### Prevalence of hepatitis C virus antibodies in Sydney blood donors.

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies in the Sydney blood donor population.
METHODS    				All blood donations collected from Red Cross blood donors in Sydney from February 1990 until April 1991 were tested for HCV antibodies.
METHODS    				For those samples found reactive in an anti-HCV screening test, a confirmatory test was carried out for the presence of HCV antibodies and the alanine aminotransferase level was measured.
RESULTS    				The prevalence of repeated reactivity to the screening test was 0.45% among blood donations overall, and 1.02% in donors giving blood for the first time in the study period.
RESULTS    				The confirmatory test result was positive for 30.8% of donations found to be repeatedly reactive in the screening test.
RESULTS    				There was little change over the study period in the HCV antibody prevalence of donors giving blood for the first time, but there was a clear decrease in the prevalence among all donations.
RESULTS    				Prevalence in males was nearly twice the prevalence in females--a difference which was consistent across age groups.
RESULTS    				The highest prevalence in both sexes was in the age group 30-34 years.
RESULTS    				Among samples for which the screening test results was positive, there was a strong correlation between the reactivity recorded for the screening test and both the proportion found positive by the confirmatory test and the proportion with an elevated alanine aminotransferase level.
CONCLUSIONS				The small proportion of blood donations found to be repeatedly reactive by anti-HCV screening and the relatively good correlation with the confirmatory test and liver function assay indicate that a policy of discarding these donations will decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted HCV infection without materially affecting the supply of blood.

#### Risk factors for hepatitis C virus infection in blood donors: a case-control study.

OBJECTIVE  				To investigate risk factors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in Sydney blood donors.
METHODS    				Blood donors confirmed to be positive for HCV antibodies were compared with blood donors with a positive result of a screening assay, but whose HCV antibody status had not been confirmed.
METHODS    				A questionnaire on sexual, parenteral and other potential risk factors was administered to both groups.
METHODS    				Blood Transfusion Service in Sydney.
METHODS    				The study enrolled 220 donors who had confirmed HCV infection, and 210 donors who did not.
RESULTS    				The relative risk associated with injecting drug use was 63 (95% confidence interval, 19-260) when comparison was made with all other donors.
RESULTS    				Among donors who did not report injecting drug use, a significant, independent increase in risk was found in association with having had a tattoo.
RESULTS    				Among donors who did not give a history of parenteral exposure, there was a significantly greater risk in people with more than one life-time sexual partner than in those with at most one partner.
CONCLUSIONS				A history of injecting drug use was elicited as the most important risk factor in Sydney blood donors with antibodies to hepatitis C. Having had a tattoo, and an increased number of lifetime sexual partners were also independently associated with HCV infection.

#### Clinical assessment and incidence of hepatitis C RNA in 50 consecutive RIBA-positive volunteer blood donors.

OBJECTIVE  				(i) To assess evidence of liver disease in 50 consecutive volunteer blood donors who were anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) antibody positive and who were referred to one hepatologist; (ii) to assay for viral RNA in serum in these patients.
METHODS    				Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, a teaching hospital of the University of Sydney.
METHODS    				Fifty people who were detected by the NSW Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service to be anti-HCV antibody positive and to have a positive result on recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) were assessed by one hepatologist for symptoms, signs and biochemical evidence of hepatic dysfunction.
METHODS    				These patients were consecutive referrals from this source.
METHODS    				Sixteen of these patients also consented to liver biopsy assessment.
METHODS    				All patients had serum assayed for viral RNA by polymerase chain reaction with a combination of 3' and 5' primers.
RESULTS    				The 50 blood donors consisted of 28 men and 22 women, with a mean age of 34.5 years.
RESULTS    				Forty-six patients were asymptomatic.
RESULTS    				Only six had a past history of hepatitis while 14 had minor signs of chronic liver disease.
RESULTS    				In 28, injecting drug use was thought the most likely source of exposure to HCV.
RESULTS    				The minimal mean time since exposure to HCV in these patients was 8.8 +/- 5.2 years.
RESULTS    				Eight patients had received a blood transfusion at a mean time of 15.0 +/- 9.8 years from the time of consultation.
RESULTS    				The mean maximum level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in all 50 patients was 102.8 U/L. Five patients had persistently normal ALT levels; another 22 had at least one normal ALT level.
RESULTS    				Liver biopsies indicated chronic persistent hepatitis in 11 patients, mild chronic active hepatitis in three patients and more severe chronic active hepatitis in one.
RESULTS    				One patient had cirrhosis on biopsy.
RESULTS    				Forty-two patients had viral RNA detected in serum.
CONCLUSIONS				Chronic infection with HCV in blood donors was invariably asymptomatic; 78% of patients had no signs of chronic liver disease and 68% had a maximum hepatic transaminase level of less than 100 U/L. Although severe liver disease was seen in two of 16 biopsies, the majority of these patients have mild liver disease despite a mean of about 10 years since exposure to the virus.
CONCLUSIONS				Eighty-four per cent of patients had evidence of viral RNA in serum.

#### A case of human melioidosis originating in south-west Western Australia.

OBJECTIVE  				To report the first human case of autochthonous melioidosis in temperate Australia (latitude 31 degrees 10'S) and to describe the extent of the presence of the causative agent, Pseudomonas pseudomallei, in southwest Western Australia.
METHODS    				A 45-year-old man living on a hobby farm was admitted to hospital for investigation of lung lesions, weight loss and low grade fevers.
METHODS    				P. pseudomallei was cultured from material from an aspiration biopsy of a mediastinal mass.
RESULTS    				The patient was successfully treated with a regimen of ceftazidime and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
RESULTS    				A review of epidemiological data showed that, since 1967, P. pseudomallei has been cultured from animals and soil in a region 50-250 km north-west of Perth, Western Australia, and that pockets of endemicity are found in the districts of Toodyay (where our patient's farm was), Chittering, Ballidu, Gidgegannup, Badgingarra, and Wongan Hills.
CONCLUSIONS				The persistence of the bacterium in animals and soil in south-west Western Australia demonstrates abundantly that P. pseudomallei can exist opportunely beyond its traditional tropical habitat.
CONCLUSIONS				It is likely that there will be further clinical cases of melioidosis originating in this region, and that the boundaries of endemicity in Australia will expand further.

#### The efficacy of serum prostate specific antigen as a tumour marker in prostatic carcinoma: a comparison with serum acid phosphatase.

OBJECTIVE  				To assess the efficacy of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the diagnosis of prostatic cancer.
OBJECTIVE  				To compare this tumour marker with serum acid phosphatase (ACP) in order to define the more effective diagnostic test.
METHODS    				Serum samples from 349 patients attending a urology department were assayed for PSA and ACP.
METHODS    				Histological assessment of prostatic biopsy samples was used as the standard by which the diagnostic effectiveness of the tumour markers was determined.
RESULTS    				Mean serum PSA results from patients with prostatic carcinoma (159 (SEM 35) ng/mL) were significantly different to those from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (4.0 (0.53) ng/mL).
RESULTS    				As there was considerable overlap of results, test sensitivities and specificities were calculated for various decision points.
RESULTS    				The sensitivity and specificity of PSA at a level of 10 ng/mL were 61.2% and 93.0% respectively, while for ACP at a level of 0.8 U/L they were 47.6% and 89.9%.
RESULTS    				The areas beneath receiver-operator curves (0.81 for PSA and 0.72 for ACP) indicated that PSA gives better diagnostic information than ACP.
RESULTS    				For a stated incidence of cancer, posttest probabilities following a given PSA result have been calculated.
CONCLUSIONS				PSA is a more effective serum marker for prostatic carcinoma than ACP.
CONCLUSIONS				We present a table so that for similar patient groups posttest probabilities for prostatic cancer can be assessed for a given serum PSA level.

#### Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection: is it worthwhile?

OBJECTIVE  				To determine the diagnostic accuracy of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a selected group of patients with HIV infection, who had severe symptoms unresponsive to empirical treatment.
METHODS    				We reviewed all patients with HIV infection, who had undergone upper gastrointestinal endoscopy at Auckland Hospital.
METHODS    				Specific diagnoses were based on the endoscopic appearances and on the histological and microbiological examination of endoscopic biopsies taken from the oesophagus, stomach and duodenum.
RESULTS    				A definitive diagnosis was reached in 16 of the 21 patients endoscoped, of whom 13 had a good clinical response to treatment.
RESULTS    				The median survival was three months.
RESULTS    				The most common diagnosis was oesophageal candidiasis seen in six patients, all of whom responded to treatment with a median survival of six months.
RESULTS    				Invasive cytomegalovirus gastrointestinal disease was seen in three patients, none of whom had positive blood cultures for cytomegalovirus.
RESULTS    				All responded to intravenous ganciclovir.
RESULTS    				Three patients with severe diarrhoea had opportunistic infection of the small bowel.
RESULTS    				All three had advanced AIDS with a median survival of less than one month.
CONCLUSIONS				Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy has a high diagnostic yield in patients with HIV infection with oesophageal symptoms which fail to respond to antifungal therapy, or with severe weight loss and diarrhoea and it should be considered in these patients because excellent palliation may be possible.

#### Healthy lifestyles are associated with higher natural killer cell activity.

BACKGROUND 				To investigate the association of individual lifestyle with immune response against tumors, we assayed peripheral blood lymphocytes of 62 healthy males ranging in age from 30 to 60 years for natural killer (NK) cell activity, which is the first line of defense against tumors, and for frequencies of NK cell subsets.
METHODS    				The NK cell activity was determined by 51Cr release assay, and NK cell subsets were counted using surface antigens (CD16, CD57) which recognize NK cell subgroups with different cytolytic potentials.
METHODS    				Subjects were classified into groups reporting good, moderate, and poor lifestyles according to their responses on a questionnaire regarding eight health practices (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, hours of sleep, physical exercise, eating breakfast, balanced nutrition, hours of work habits, and mental stress).
RESULTS    				Individuals reporting good lifestyle habits were found to have the highest NK cell activity and it was significantly higher than the NK cell activity in those reporting poor lifestyle habits.
RESULTS    				Those reporting good health practices regarding smoking and physical exercise showed significantly higher NK cell activity at an effector-to-target-cell ratio of 40:1.
CONCLUSIONS				The higher NK cell activity among individuals reporting good lifestyle practices may reflect an increase in the cytolytic potential of NK cell activity within the CD16+, CD57- subset.

#### Ischemia-induced extracellular release of serotonin plays a role in CA1 neuronal cell death in rats.

OBJECTIVE  				Serotonin, via 5-HT2 receptors, exerts an excitatory effect on CA1 neurons and may play a role in ischemia-induced excitotoxic damage.
OBJECTIVE  				To evaluate the role of serotonin in ischemia, both neurochemical and histopathological studies were performed.
METHODS    				Neurochemical studies included rats that were subjected to 12.5 or 20 minutes of normothermic ischemia by two-vessel occlusion plus hypotension, and extracellular serotonin levels were measured in the hippocampus (12.5 minutes' ischemia, n = 5) or striatum (20 minutes' ischemia, n = 13) by microdialysis.
METHODS    				In the histopathological study the effect of 8 mg/kg ritanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, administered continuously from 30 minutes prior to ischemia until 1 hour of recirculation was evaluated in five rats subjected to 10 minutes of ischemia.
METHODS    				After 3 days, the numbers of normal-appearing neurons in the CA1 subregions were counted.
RESULTS    				Ischemia of 12.5 minutes' duration induced a fourfold increase in serotonin in the hippocampus (mean +/- SEM baseline, 1.86 +/- 0.25 pmol/ml perfusate; during ischemia, 8.14 +/- 0.89 pmol/ml; p < 0.05 by analysis of variance).
RESULTS    				Twenty minutes of ischemia induced a 25-fold increase in serotonin in the dorsolateral striatum (baseline, 0.98 +/- 0.15 pmol/ml; ischemia, 24.4 +/- 5.93 pmol/ml; p < 0.001).
RESULTS    				The histopathological study demonstrated severe ischemic damage in all CA1 subregions of nontreated animals (medial, 34 +/- 16 normal-appearing neurons, middle, 52.2 +/- 22.9 neurons; lateral, 56.6 +/- 21.8 neurons).
RESULTS    				Treatment with ritanserin significantly attenuated ischemic damage (medial, 117.6 +/- 6.5 neurons; middle, 131.4 +/- 4.9 neurons; lateral, 130 +/- 7.5 neurons; p < 0.01 different from nontreated).
CONCLUSIONS				Taken together, these results suggest that serotonin plays a detrimental role, mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, in the development of ischemic damage.

#### Effects of nicardipine on tube formation of bovine vascular endothelial cells in vitro.

OBJECTIVE  				The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of nicardipine, a Ca2+ channel blocker, on angiogenesis in vitro.
METHODS    				Bovine carotid artery endothelial cells were cultured between type I collagen gel layers with 10(-9) to 10(-5) M nicardipine.
METHODS    				The morphological changes were monitored by phase-contrast microscopy and photographed.
METHODS    				The total length of tubular structures was measured with an image analyzer system.
METHODS    				Endothelial proliferation and migration assays were also performed with the same doses of nicardipine.
RESULTS    				Cultured endothelial cells form tubular structures between collagen gel layers.
RESULTS    				Tube formation of endothelial cells was suppressed by culture with 10(-9) to 10(-5) M nicardipine in a dose-dependent manner.
RESULTS    				Migration of endothelial cells was also suppressed by the same doses of nicardipine.
RESULTS    				However, proliferation of endothelial cells was not enhanced.
CONCLUSIONS				Nicardipine acts as an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vitro by inhibiting the migration of endothelial cells.
CONCLUSIONS				This result suggests that nicardipine may have therapeutic potential in angiogenic disorders such as tumor growth, atherogenesis, and diabetic retinopathy.

#### Cyclooxygenase products do not modulate angiotensin II-induced contractions of human chorionic plate arteries.

OBJECTIVE  				This study sought to determine whether cyclooxygenase products modulate angiotensin II-induced contractions of human placental arteries.
METHODS    				Ring segments of chorionic plate arteries (3 to 5 mm inner diameter) were obtained after normal vaginal deliveries.
METHODS    				Active force in response to 10(-6) mol/L angiotensin II or 10(-4) mol/L arachidonic acid was measured in the presence or absence of 10(-6) mol/L indomethacin to inhibit cyclooxygenase.
METHODS    				The response of K+ contracted arteries to the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost was also tested to determine whether prostacyclin relaxes these vessels.
METHODS    				Statistical differences were assessed by analysis of variance, Wilcoxon sign rank test, or Student t test with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS    				Successive applications of angiotensin II produced significantly less contraction than the original dose (angiotensin II tachyphylaxis).
RESULTS    				Angiotensin II tachyphylaxis was unaffected by indomethacin.
RESULTS    				Arachidonic acid caused an indomethacin-sensitive contraction and iloprost failed to relax the arteries.
CONCLUSIONS				These results suggest that cyclooxygenase products do not mediate angiotensin II tachyphylaxis in these vessels.

#### Simplified gram stain interpretive method for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.

OBJECTIVE  				Two methods which only consider bacterial morphotypes and require counting various types of bacteria, for interpreting Gram stains of vaginal secretions for the purpose of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis were previously described.
OBJECTIVE  				A new interpretative method, which combines clue cells with bacterial morphotypes as diagnostic markers, is offered.
METHODS    				One hundred twenty patients were tested with the new interpretative method and clinical criteria of bacterial vaginosis as the reference standard.
RESULTS    				The new method was found comparable to older methods when all were compared with clinical diagnostic methods.
RESULTS    				The sensitivity of the clue cell method was 86.1% and the specificity was 92.8%.
RESULTS    				The predictive value of a positive test was 83.7% for a population with a prevalence of bacterial vaginosis of 30%.
RESULTS    				The negative predictive value was 94.0%.
CONCLUSIONS				If clue cells are present and the nonlactobacilli morphotypes exceed lactobacilli morphotypes, bacterial vaginosis can be diagnosed without the need for exact bacterial counts.
