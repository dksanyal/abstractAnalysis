#### Learning to Localize Sound Sources in Visual Scenes: Analysis and Applications
0 	Visual events are usually accompanied by sounds in our daily lives.
0 	However, can the machines learn to correlate the visual scene and sound, as well as localize the sound source only by observing them like humans?
0 	To investigate its empirical learnability, in this work we first present a novel unsupervised algorithm to address the problem of localizing sound sources in visual scenes.
0 	In order to achieve this goal, a two-stream network structure which handles each modality, with attention mechanism is developed for sound source localization.
0 	The network naturally reveals the localized response in the scene without human annotation.
0 	In addition, a new sound source dataset is developed for performance evaluation.
0 	Nevertheless, our empirical evaluation shows that the unsupervised method generates false conclusions in some cases.
0 	Thereby, we show that this false conclusion cannot be fixed without human prior knowledge due to the well-known correlation and causality mismatch misconception.
0 	We show that the false conclusion can be effectively corrected even with a small amount of supervision, i.e., semi-supervised setup.
0 	We present the versatility of the learned audio and visual embeddings on the cross-modal content alignment and we incorporate this proposed algorithm into sound saliency based automatic camera view panning in 360 degree videos.

#### InLoc: Indoor Visual Localization with Dense Matching and View Synthesis
0 	We seek to predict the 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a query photograph with respect to a large indoor 3D map.
0 	The contributions of this work are three-fold.
0 	First, we develop a new large-scale visual localization method targeted for indoor spaces.
0 	The method proceeds along three steps: (i) efficient retrieval of candidate poses that scales to large-scale environments, (ii) pose estimation using dense matching rather than sparse local features to deal with weakly textured indoor scenes, and (iii) pose verification by virtual view synthesis that is robust to significant changes in viewpoint, scene layout, and occlusion.
0 	Second, we release a new dataset with reference 6DoF poses for large-scale indoor localization.
0 	Query photographs are captured by mobile phones at a different time than the reference 3D map, thus presenting a realistic indoor localization scenario.
0 	Third, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art indoor localization approaches on this new challenging data.

#### Assessing Transferability from Simulation to Reality for Reinforcement Learning
0 	Learning robot control policies from physics simulations is of great interest to the robotics community as it may render the learning process faster, cheaper, and safer by alleviating the need for expensive real-world experiments.
0 	However, the direct transfer of learned behavior from simulation to reality is a major challenge.
0 	Optimizing a policy on a slightly faulty simulator can easily lead to the maximization of the ‘Simulation Optimization Bias’ (SOB).
0 	In this case, the optimizer exploits modeling errors of the simulator such that the resulting behavior can potentially damage the robot.
0 	We tackle this challenge by applying domain randomization, i.e., randomizing the parameters of the physics simulations during learning.
0 	We propose an algorithm called Simulation-based Policy Optimization with Transferability Assessment (SPOTA) which uses an estimator of the SOB to formulate a stopping criterion for training.
0 	The introduced estimator quantifies the over-fitting to the set of domains experienced while training.
0 	Our experimental results on two different second order nonlinear systems show that the new simulation-based policy search algorithm is able to learn a control policy exclusively from a randomized simulator, which can be applied directly to real systems without any additional training.

#### Scalar Quantization as Sparse Least Square Optimization
0 	Quantization aims to form new vectors or matrices with shared values close to the original.
0 	In recent years, the popularity of scalar quantization has been soaring as it has been found huge utilities in reducing the resource cost of neural networks.
0 	Popular clustering-based techniques suffers substantially from the problems of dependency on the seed, empty or out-of-the-range clusters, and high time complexity.
0 	To overcome the problems, scalar quantization is examined from a new perspective, namely sparse least square optimization.
0 	Specifically, several quantization algorithms based on l1 least square are proposed and implemented.
0 	In addition, similar schemes with l1+ l2 and l0 regularization are proposed.
0 	Furthermore, to compute quantization results with given amount of values/clusters, this paper proposes an iterative method and a clustering-based method, and both of them are built on sparse least square.
0 	The algorithms proposed are tested under three data scenarios and their computational performance, including information loss, time consumption and distribution of values of sparse vectors are compared.
0 	The paper offers a new perspective to probe the area of quantization, and the algorithms proposed are superior especially under bit-width reducing scenarios, when the required post-quantization resolution is not significantly lower than the original scalar.

#### Affine Invariants of Vector Fields
0 	Vector fields are a special kind of multidimensional data, which are in a certain sense similar to digital color images, but are distinct from them in several aspects.
0 	In each pixel, the field is assigned to a vector that shows the direction and the magnitude of the quantity, which has been measured.
0 	To detect the patterns of interest in the field, special matching methods must be developed.
0 	In this paper, we propose a method for the description and matching of vector field patterns under an unknown affine transformation of the field.
0 	Unlike digital images, transformations of vector fields act not only on the spatial coordinates but also on the field values, which makes the detection different from the image case.
0 	To measure the similarity between the template and the field patch, we propose original invariants with respect to total affine transformation.

#### A Temporally-Aware Interpolation Network for Video Frame Inpainting
0 	In this work, we explore video frame inpainting, a task that lies at the intersection of general video inpainting, frame interpolation, and video prediction.
0 	Although our problem can be addressed by applying methods from other video interpolation or extrapolation tasks, doing so fails to leverage the additional context information that our problem provides.
0 	To this end, we devise a method specifically designed for video frame inpainting that is composed of two modules: a bidirectional video prediction module and a temporally-aware frame interpolation module.
0 	The prediction module makes two intermediate predictions of the missing frames, each conditioned on the preceding and following frames respectively, using a shared convolutional LSTM-based encoder-decoder.
0 	The interpolation module blends the intermediate predictions by using time information and hidden activations from the video prediction module to resolve disagreements between the predictions.

#### SpaRTA Tracking across occlusions via partitioning of 3D clouds of points
0 	Any 3D tracking algorithm has to deal with occlusions: multiple targets get so close to each other that the loss of their identities becomes likely, hence potentially affecting the very quality of the data with interrupted trajectories and identity switches.
0 	Here, we present a novel tracking method that addresses the problem of occlusions within large groups of featureless objects by means of three steps: i) it represents each target as a cloud of points in 3D; ii) once a 3D cluster corresponding to an occlusion occurs, it defines a partitioning problem by introducing a cost function that uses both attractive and repulsive spatio-temporal proximity links; iii) it minimizes the cost function through a semi-definite optimization technique specifically designed to cope with the presence of multi-minima landscapes.
0 	The algorithm is designed to work on 3D data regardless of the experimental method used: multi--camera systems, lidars, radars and RGB-D systems.
0 	By performing tests on public data-sets, we show that the new algorithm produces a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art tracking methods, both by reducing the number of identity switches and by increasing the accuracy of the estimated positions of the targets in real space.

#### Effects of Image Degradation and Degradation Removal to CNN-based Image Classification
0 	Just like many other topics in computer vision, image classification has achieved significant progress recently by using deep learning neural networks, especially the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
0 	Most of the existing works focused on classifying very clear natural images, evidenced by the widely used image databases such as Caltech-256, PASCAL VOCs and ImageNet.
0 	However, in many real applications, the acquired images may contain certain degradations that lead to various kinds of blurring, noise, and distortions.
0 	One important and interesting problem is the effect of such degradations to the performance of CNN-based image classification and whether degradation removal helps CNN-based image classification.
0 	More specifically, we wonder whether image classification performance drops with each kind of degradation, whether this drop can be avoided by including degraded images into training, and whether existing computer vision algorithms that attempt to remove such degradations can help improve the image classification performance.
0 	In this paper, we empirically study those problems for nine kinds of degraded images - hazy images, motion-blurred images, fish-eye images, underwater images, low resolution images, salt-and-peppered images, images with white Gaussian noise, Gaussian-blurred images and out-of-focus images.
0 	We expect this work can draw more interests from the community to study the classification of degraded images.

#### Topology-Aware Non-Rigid Point Cloud Registration
0 	In this paper, we introduce a non-rigid registration pipeline for unorganized point clouds that may be topologically different.
0 	Standard warp field estimation algorithms, even under robust, discontinuity-preserving regularization, produce erratic motion estimates on boundaries associated with ‘close-to-open’ topology changes.
0 	We overcome this limitation by exploiting backward motion: in the opposite direction, a ‘close-to-open’ event becomes ‘open-to-close’, which is by default handled correctly.
0 	Our approach relies on a general, topology-agnostic warp field estimation algorithm, similar to those employed in recent dynamic reconstruction systems from RGB-D input.
0 	We improve motion estimation on boundaries associated with topology changes in an efficient post-processing phase.
0 	Based on both forward and (inverted) backward warp hypotheses, we explicitly detect regions of the deformed geometry that undergo topological changes by means of local deformation criteria and broadly classify them as ‘contacts’ or ‘separations’.
0 	Subsequently, the two motion hypotheses are seamlessly blended on a local basis, according to the type and proximity of detected events.
0 	Our method achieves state-of-the-art motion estimation accuracy on the MPI Sintel dataset.

#### MTFH: A Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing Framework for Efficient Cross-Modal Retrieval
0 	Hashing has recently sparked a great revolution in cross-modal retrieval because of its low storage cost and high query speed.
0 	Recent cross-modal hashing methods often learn unified or equal-length hash codes to represent the multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable.
0 	However, such representations could inherently sacrifice their representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not have one-to-one correspondence and could be encoded more efficiently by different hash codes of unequal lengths.
0 	To mitigate these problems, this paper exploits a related and relatively unexplored problem: encode the heterogeneous data with varying hash lengths and generalize the cross-modal retrieval in various challenging scenarios.
0 	To this end, a generalized and flexible cross-modal hashing framework, termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH), is proposed to work seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired multi-modal data, and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios.
0 	MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to flexibly learn modality-specific hash codes with different length settings, while synchronously learning two semantic correlation matrices for heterogeneous data comparable.
0 	As a result, the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks.
0 	Extensive experiments evaluated on public benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of MTFH under various retrieval scenarios and show its competitive performance with the state-of-the-arts.

#### Learning Part-based Convolutional Features for Person Re-identification
0 	Part-level features offers fine granularity for pedestrian image description.
0 	In this article, we generally aim to learn discriminative part-informed features for person re-identification.
0 	Our contribution is two-fold.
0 	First, we introduce a general part-level feature learning method, named Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB).
0 	Given an image, it outputs a convolutional descriptor consisting of several part-level features.
0 	PCB is general in that it is able to accommodate several part partitioning strategies.
0 	In experiment, we show that the learned descriptor maintains a significantly higher discriminative ability than the global descriptor.
0 	Second, Based on PCB, we propose refined part pooling (RPP) to improve the original partition.
0 	Our idea is that pixels within a well-located part should be similar to each other while being dissimilar with pixels from other parts.
0 	We call it within-part consistency.
0 	When a pixel-wise feature vector in a part is more similar to some other part, it is then an outlier, indicating inappropriate partitioning.
0 	RPP re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in refined parts with enhanced within-part consistency.
0 	Experiment confirms that RPP gains another round of performance boost over PCB.

0 	As not all frames may characterize the underlying action, pooling schemes that impose equal importance on all frames might be unfavorable.
0 	To tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the notion that among the features generated on all short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action.
0 	To identify useful features, we resort to a negative bag consisting of features that are known to be irrelevant.
0 	With the features from the video as a positive bag and the irrelevant features as the negative bag, we cast an objective to learn a (nonlinear) hyperplane that separates the unknown useful feature from the rest in a multiple instance learning formulation within a support vector machine setup.

#### SafePredict: A Meta-Algorithm for Machine Learning That Uses Refusals to Guarantee Correctness
0 	SafePredict is a novel meta-algorithm that works with any base prediction algorithm for online data to guarantee an arbitrarily chosen correctness rate, $1-\in$, by allowing refusals.
0 	Allowing refusals means that the meta-algorithm may refuse to emit a prediction produced by the base algorithm on occasion so that the error rate on non-refused predictions does not exceed $\in$.
0 	The SafePredict error bound does not rely on any assumptions on the data distribution or the base predictor.
0 	When the base predictor happens not to exceed the target error rate $\in$, SafePredict refuses only a finite number of times.
0 	When the error rate of the base predictor changes through time SafePredict makes use of a weight-shifting heuristic that adapts to these changes without knowing when the changes occur yet still maintains the correctness guarantee.
0 	Empirical results show that (i) SafePredict compares favorably with state-of-the art confidence based refusal mechanisms which fail to offer robust error guarantees; and (ii) combining SafePredict with such refusal mechanisms can in many cases further reduce the number of refusals.

0 	Template-matching methods for visual tracking have gained popularity recently due to their good performance and fast speed.

0 	In this paper, we propose a dynamic memory network to adapt the template to the target's appearance variations during tracking.
0 	The reading and writing process of the external memory is controlled by an LSTM network with the search feature map as input.
0 	A spatial attention mechanism is applied to concentrate the LSTM input on the potential target as the location of the target is at first unknown.
0 	To prevent aggressive model adaptivity, we apply gated residual template learning to control the amount of retrieved memory that is used to combine with the initial template.
0 	In order to alleviate the drift problem, we also design a "negative" memory unit that stores templates for distractors, which are used to cancel out wrong responses from the object template.
0 	To further boost the tracking performance, an auxiliary classification loss is added after the feature extractor part.
0 	Unlike tracking-by-detection methods where the object's information is maintained by the weight parameters of neural networks, which requires expensive online fine-tuning to be adaptable, our tracker runs completely feed-forward and adapts to the target's appearance changes by updating the external memory.

#### Pose-Guided Representation Learning for Person Re-Identification
0 	The large pose variations and misalignment errors exhibited by person images significantly increase the difficulty of person Re-Identification (ReID).
0 	Existing works commonly apply extra operations like pose estimation, part segmentation, etc., to alleviate those issues and improve the robustness of pedestrian representations.
0 	While boosting the ReID accuracy, those operations introduce considerable computational overheads and make the deep models complex and hard to tune.
0 	To chase a more efficient solution, we propose a Part-Guided Representation (PGR) composed of Pose Invariant Feature (PIF) and Local Descriptive Feature (LDF), respectively.
0 	We call PGR "Part-Guided" because it is trained and supervised by local part cues.
0 	Specifically, PIF approximates a pose invariant representation inferred by pose estimation and pose normalization.
0 	LDF focuses on discriminative body parts by approximating a representation learned with body region segmentation.
0 	In this way, extra pose extraction is only introduced during the training stage to supervise the learning of PGR, but is not required during the testing stage for feature extraction.
0 	Extensive comparisons with recent works on five widely used datasets demonstrate the competitive accuracy and efficiency of PGR.

0 	We give a unified presentation of the surrogate-based formulations that incorporate the features of rectification and alignment simultaneously, and establish worst-case error bounds of the recovered tensor.

#### On Learning 3D Face Morphable Model from In-the-wild Images
0 	As a classic statistical model of 3D facial shape and albedo, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is widely used in facial analysis, e.g., model fitting, image synthesis.
0 	Conventional 3DMM is learned from a set of well-controlled 2D face images with associated 3D face scans, and represented by two sets of PCA basis functions.
0 	Due to the type and amount of training data, as well as, the linear bases, the representation power of 3DMM can be limited.
0 	To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative framework to learn a nonlinear 3DMM model from a large set of unconstrained face images, without collecting 3D face scans.
0 	Specifically, given a face image as input, a network encoder estimates the projection, illumination, shape and albedo parameters.
0 	Two decoders serve as the nonlinear 3DMM to map from the shape and albedo parameters to the 3D shape and albedo, respectively.
0 	With the projection parameter, lighting, 3D shape, and albedo, a novel analytically-differentiable rendering layer is designed to reconstruct the original input face.
0 	The entire network is end-to-end trainable with only weak supervision.
0 	We demonstrate the superior representation power of our nonlinear 3DMM over its linear counterpart, and its contribution to face alignment and 3D reconstruction.

0 	We propose DoubleFusion, a new real-time system that combines volumetric non-rigid reconstruction with data-driven template fitting to simultaneously reconstruct detailed surface geometry, large non-rigid motion, and the optimized human body shape from a single depth camera.
0 	One of the key contributions of this method is a double-layer representation consisting of a complete parametric body model inside, and a gradually fused detailed surface outside.
0 	A pre-defined node graph on the body parameterizes the non-rigid deformations near the body, and a free-form dynamically changing graph parameterizes the outer surface layer far from the body, which allows more general reconstruction.
0 	We further propose a joint motion tracking method based on the double-layer representation to enable robust and fast motion tracking performance.
0 	Moreover, the inner parametric body is optimized online and forced to fit inside the outer surface layer as well as the live depth input.

#### Coherence Constrained Graph LSTM for Group Activity Recognition
0 	This work aims to address the group activity recognition problem by exploring human motion characteristics.
0 	Traditional methods hold that the motions of all persons contribute equally to the group activity, which suppresses the contributions of some relevant motions to the whole activity while overstates some irrelevant motions.
0 	To handle this problem, we present a Spatio-Temporal Context Coherence (STCC) constraint and a Global Context Coherence (GCC) constraint to capture the relevant motions and quantify their contributions to the group activity, respectively.
0 	Based on this, we propose a novel Coherence Constrained Graph LSTM (CCG-LSTM) with STCC and GCC to effectively recognize group activity, by modeling the relevant motions of individuals while suppressing the irrelevant motions.
0 	Specifically, to capture the relevant motions, we build the CCG-LSTM with a temporal confidence gate and a spatial confidence gate to control the memory state updating in terms of the temporally previous state and the spatially neighboring states, respectively.
0 	Besides, an attention mechanism is employed to quantify the contribution of a certain motion by measuring the consistency between itself and the whole activity at each time step.

0 	In this paper, we propose a novel Task-Recursive Learning (TRL) framework to jointly and recurrently conduct three representative tasks therein containing depth estimation, surface normal prediction and semantic segmentation.
0 	TRL recursively refines the prediction results through a series of task-level interactions, where one-time cross-task interaction is abstracted as one network block of one time stage.
0 	In each stage, we serialize multiple tasks into a sequence and then recursively perform their interactions.
0 	To adaptively enhance counterpart patterns, we encapsulate interactions into a specific Task-Attentional Module (TAM) to mutually-boost the tasks from each other.
0 	Across stages, the historical experiences of previous states of tasks are selectively propagated into the next stages by using Feature-Selection unit (FS-Unit), which takes advantage of complementary information across tasks.

#### Variational Context: Exploiting Visual and Textual Context for Grounding Referring Expressions
0 	We focus on grounding (i.e., localizing or linking) referring expressions in images, e.g., "largest elephant standing behind baby elephant".
0 	This is a general yet challenging vision-language task since it does not only require the localization of objects, but also the multimodal comprehension of context - visual attributes (e.g., "largest", "baby") and relationships (e.g., "behind") that help to distinguish the referent from other objects, especially those of the same category.
0 	Due to the exponential complexity involved in modeling the context associated with multiple image regions, existing work oversimplifies this task to pairwise region modeling by multiple instance learning.
0 	In this paper, we propose a variational Bayesian method, called Variational Context, to solve the problem of complex context modeling in referring expression grounding.
0 	Our model exploits the reciprocal relation between the referent and context, i.e., either of them influences estimation of the posterior distribution of the other, and thereby the search space of context can be greatly reduced.

0 	A single-shot variational approach is first put forward, which is effective as long as the target's reflectance is piecewise-constant.

#### RotationNet for Joint Object Categorization and Unsupervised Pose Estimation from Multi-view Images
0 	We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model "RotationNet," which takes multi-view images of an object as input and jointly estimates its pose and object category.
0 	Unlike previous approaches that use known viewpoint labels for training, our method treats the viewpoint labels as latent variables, which are learned in an unsupervised manner during the training using an unaligned object dataset.
0 	RotationNet uses only a partial set of multi-view images for inference, and this property makes it useful in practical scenarios where only partial views are available.
0 	Moreover, our pose alignment strategy enables one to obtain view-specific feature representations shared across classes, which is important to maintain high accuracy in both object categorization and pose estimation.
0 	Effectiveness of RotationNet is demonstrated by its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods of 3D object classification on 10- and 40-class ModelNet datasets.
0 	We also show that RotationNet, even trained without known poses, achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on an object pose estimation dataset.

#### One shot segmentation: unifying rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation using elastic regularization
0 	This paper proposes a novel approach for the non-rigid segmentation of deformable objects in image sequences, which is based on one-shot segmentation that unifies rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation using elastic regularization.
0 	The domain of application is the segmentation of a visual object that temporally undergoes a rigid transformation (e.g., affine transformation) and a non-rigid transformation (i.e., contour deformation).
0 	The majority of segmentation approaches to solve this problem are generally based on two steps that run in sequence: a rigid detection, followed by a non-rigid segmentation.
0 	In this paper, we propose a new approach, where both the rigid and non-rigid segmentation are performed in a single shot using a sparse low-dimensional manifold that represents the visual object deformations.
0 	Given the multi-modality of these deformations, the manifold partitions the training data into several patches, where each patch provides a segmentation proposal during the inference process.
0 	These multiple segmentation proposals are merged using the classification results produced by deep belief networks (DBN) that compute the confidence on each segmentation proposal.
0 	Thus, an ensemble of DBN classifiers is used for estimating the final segmentation.
0 	Compared to current methods proposed in the field, our proposed approach is advantageous in four aspects: (i) it is a unified framework to produce rigid and non-rigid segmentations; (ii) it uses an ensemble classification process, which can help the segmentation robustness; (iii) it provides a significant reduction in terms of the number of dimensions of the rigid and non-rigid segmentations search spaces, compared to current approaches that divide these two problems; and (iv) this lower dimensionality of the search space can also reduce the need for large annotated training sets to be used for estimating the DBN models.
0 	Experiments on the problem of left ventricle endocardial segmentation from ultrasound images, and lip segmentation from frontal facial images using the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database, demonstrate the potential of the methodology through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and the ability to reduce the search and training complexities without a significant impact on the segmentation accuracy.

0 	Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa.

0 	Recent advances in object detection heavily depend on the off-the-shelf models pre-trained on large-scale classification datasets like ImageNet and OpenImage.
0 	However, one problem is that adopting pre-trained models from classification to detection task may incur learning bias due to the different objective function and diverse distributions of object categories.
0 	Techniques like fine-tuning on detection task could alleviate this issue to some extent but are still not fundamental.
0 	Furthermore, transferring these pre-trained models cross discrepant domains will be more difficult (e.g., from RGB to depth images).
0 	Thus, a better solution to handle these critical problems is to train object detectors from scratch, which motivates our proposed method.
0 	In DSOD, we contribute a set of design principles for learning object detectors from scratch.
0 	One of the key principles is the deep supervision, enabled by layer-wise dense connections in both backbone networks and prediction layers, plays a critical role in learning good detectors from scratch.

#### Semantic Fisher Scores for Task Transfer: Using Objects to Classify Scenes
0 	The tranfer of a neural network (CNN) trained to recognize objects to the task of scene classification is considered.
0 	A Bag-of-Semantics (BoS) representation is first induced, by feeding scene image patches to the object CNN, and representing the scene image by the ensuing bag of posterior class probability vectors (semantic posteriors).
0 	The encoding of the BoS with a Fisher vector (FV) is then studied.
0 	A link is established between the FV of any probabilistic model and the Q-function of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm used to estimate its parameters by maximum likelihood.
0 	This enables 1) imediate derivation of FVs for any model for which an EM algorithm exists, and 2) leveraging efficient implementations from the EM literature for the computation of FVs.
0 	It is then shown that standard FVs, such as those derived from Gaussian or even Dirichelet mixtures, are unsuccessful for the transfer of semantic posteriors, due to the highly non-linear nature of the probability simplex.
0 	The analysis of these FVs shows that significant benefits can ensue by 1) designing FVs in the natural parameter space of the multinomial distribution, and 2) adopting sophisticated probabilistic models of semantic feature covariance.
0 	The combination of these two insights leads to the encoding of the BoS in the natural parameter space of the multinomial, using a vector of Fisher scores derived from a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA).
0 	A network implementation of the MFA Fisher Score (MFA-FS), denoted as the MFAFSNet, is finally proposed to enable end-to-end training.
0 	Experiments with various object CNNs and datasets show that the approach has state-of-the-art transfer performance.
0 	Somewhat surprisingly, the scene classification results are superior to those of a CNN explicitly trained for scene classification, using a large scene dataset (Places).
0 	This suggests that holistic analysis is insufficient for scene classification.
0 	The modeling of local object semantics appears to be at least equally important.

#### A Functional Representation for Graph Matching
0 	Graph matching is an important and persistent problem in computer vision and pattern recognition for finding node-to-node correspondence between graphs.
0 	However, graph matching that incorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational difficulties.
0 	This paper presents a functional representation for graph matching (FRGM) that aims to provide more geometric insights on the problem and reduce the space and time complexities.
0 	To achieve these goals, we represent each graph by a linear function space equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that has an explicit geometric meaning.
0 	Consequently, the correspondence matrix between graphs can be represented as a linear representation map.
0 	Furthermore, this map can be reformulated as a new parameterization for matching graphs in Euclidean space such that it is consistent with graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations.
0 	This allows us to estimate the correspondence matrix and geometric deformations simultaneously.
0 	We use the representation of edge-attributes rather than the affinity matrix to reduce the space complexity and propose an efficient optimization strategy to reduce the time complexity.
0 	The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the FRGM can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

#### Robust RGB-D Face Recognition Using Attribute-Aware Loss
0 	Existing convolutional neural network (CNN) based face recognition algorithms typically learn a discriminative feature mapping, using a loss function that enforces separation of features from different classes and/or aggregation of features within the same class.
0 	However, they may suffer from bias in the training data such as uneven sampling density, because they optimize the adjacency relationship of the learned features without considering the proximity of the underlying faces.
0 	Moreover, since they only use facial images for training, the learned feature mapping may not correctly indicate the relationship of other attributes such as gender and ethnicity, which can be important for some face recognition applications.
0 	In this paper, we propose a new CNN-based face recognition approach that incorporates such attributes into the training process.
0 	Using an attribute-aware loss function that regularizes the feature mapping using attribute proximity, our approach learns more discriminative features that are correlated with the attributes.
0 	We train our face recognition model on a large-scale RGB-D data set with over 100K identities captured under real application conditions.

#### Convolutional Networks with Dense Connectivity
0 	Recent work has shown that convolutional networks can be substantially deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output.
0 	In this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion.
0 	Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers have L connections -- one between each layer and its subsequent layer -- our network has $\frac{L(L+1)}{2}$ direct connections.
0 	For each layer, the feature-maps of all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as inputs into all subsequent layers.

#### Learning More Universal Representations for Transfer-Learning
0 	A representation is supposed universal if it encodes any element of the visual world (e.g., objects, scenes) in any configuration (e.g., scale, context).
0 	While not expecting pure universal representations, the goal in the literature is to improve the universality level, starting from a representation with a certain level.
0 	To improve that universality level, one can diversify the source-task, but it requires many additive annotated data that is costly in terms of manual work and possible expertise.
0 	We formalize such a diversification process then propose two methods to improve the universality of CNN representations that limit the need for additive annotated data.
0 	The first relies on human categorization knowledge and the second on re-training using fine-tuning.
0 	We propose a new aggregating metric to evaluate the universality in a transfer-learning scheme, that addresses more aspects than previous works.
0 	Based on it, we show the interest of our methods on 10 target-problems, relating to classification on a variety of visual domains.

#### Learning to Localize Sound Sources in Visual Scenes: Analysis and Applications
0 	Visual events are usually accompanied by sounds in our daily lives.
0 	However, can the machines learn to correlate the visual scene and sound, as well as localize the sound source only by observing them like humans?
0 	To investigate its empirical learnability, in this work we first present a novel unsupervised algorithm to address the problem of localizing sound sources in visual scenes.
0 	In order to achieve this goal, a two-stream network structure which handles each modality, with attention mechanism is developed for sound source localization.
0 	The network naturally reveals the localized response in the scene without human annotation.
0 	In addition, a new sound source dataset is developed for performance evaluation.
0 	Nevertheless, our empirical evaluation shows that the unsupervised method generates false conclusions in some cases.
0 	Thereby, we show that this false conclusion cannot be fixed without human prior knowledge due to the well-known correlation and causality mismatch misconception.
0 	We show that the false conclusion can be effectively corrected even with a small amount of supervision, i.e., semi-supervised setup.
0 	We present the versatility of the learned audio and visual embeddings on the cross-modal content alignment and we incorporate this proposed algorithm into sound saliency based automatic camera view panning in 360 degree videos.

0 	We seek to predict the 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a query photograph with respect to a large indoor 3D map.
0 	The contributions of this work are three-fold.
0 	First, we develop a new large-scale visual localization method targeted for indoor spaces.
0 	The method proceeds along three steps: (i) efficient retrieval of candidate poses that scales to large-scale environments, (ii) pose estimation using dense matching rather than sparse local features to deal with weakly textured indoor scenes, and (iii) pose verification by virtual view synthesis that is robust to significant changes in viewpoint, scene layout, and occlusion.
0 	Second, we release a new dataset with reference 6DoF poses for large-scale indoor localization.
0 	Query photographs are captured by mobile phones at a different time than the reference 3D map, thus presenting a realistic indoor localization scenario.

#### Assessing Transferability from Simulation to Reality for Reinforcement Learning
0 	Learning robot control policies from physics simulations is of great interest to the robotics community as it may render the learning process faster, cheaper, and safer by alleviating the need for expensive real-world experiments.
0 	However, the direct transfer of learned behavior from simulation to reality is a major challenge.
0 	Optimizing a policy on a slightly faulty simulator can easily lead to the maximization of the ‘Simulation Optimization Bias’ (SOB).
0 	In this case, the optimizer exploits modeling errors of the simulator such that the resulting behavior can potentially damage the robot.
0 	We tackle this challenge by applying domain randomization, i.e., randomizing the parameters of the physics simulations during learning.
0 	We propose an algorithm called Simulation-based Policy Optimization with Transferability Assessment (SPOTA) which uses an estimator of the SOB to formulate a stopping criterion for training.
0 	The introduced estimator quantifies the over-fitting to the set of domains experienced while training.
0 	Our experimental results on two different second order nonlinear systems show that the new simulation-based policy search algorithm is able to learn a control policy exclusively from a randomized simulator, which can be applied directly to real systems without any additional training.

#### Scalar Quantization as Sparse Least Square Optimization
0 	Quantization aims to form new vectors or matrices with shared values close to the original.
0 	In recent years, the popularity of scalar quantization has been soaring as it has been found huge utilities in reducing the resource cost of neural networks.
0 	Popular clustering-based techniques suffers substantially from the problems of dependency on the seed, empty or out-of-the-range clusters, and high time complexity.
0 	To overcome the problems, scalar quantization is examined from a new perspective, namely sparse least square optimization.
0 	Specifically, several quantization algorithms based on l1 least square are proposed and implemented.
0 	In addition, similar schemes with l1+ l2 and l0 regularization are proposed.
0 	Furthermore, to compute quantization results with given amount of values/clusters, this paper proposes an iterative method and a clustering-based method, and both of them are built on sparse least square.

0 	Vector fields are a special kind of multidimensional data, which are in a certain sense similar to digital color images, but are distinct from them in several aspects.
0 	In each pixel, the field is assigned to a vector that shows the direction and the magnitude of the quantity, which has been measured.
0 	To detect the patterns of interest in the field, special matching methods must be developed.
0 	In this paper, we propose a method for the description and matching of vector field patterns under an unknown affine transformation of the field.
0 	Unlike digital images, transformations of vector fields act not only on the spatial coordinates but also on the field values, which makes the detection different from the image case.

#### A Temporally-Aware Interpolation Network for Video Frame Inpainting
0 	In this work, we explore video frame inpainting, a task that lies at the intersection of general video inpainting, frame interpolation, and video prediction.
0 	Although our problem can be addressed by applying methods from other video interpolation or extrapolation tasks, doing so fails to leverage the additional context information that our problem provides.
0 	To this end, we devise a method specifically designed for video frame inpainting that is composed of two modules: a bidirectional video prediction module and a temporally-aware frame interpolation module.
0 	The prediction module makes two intermediate predictions of the missing frames, each conditioned on the preceding and following frames respectively, using a shared convolutional LSTM-based encoder-decoder.
0 	The interpolation module blends the intermediate predictions by using time information and hidden activations from the video prediction module to resolve disagreements between the predictions.

#### SpaRTA Tracking across occlusions via partitioning of 3D clouds of points
0 	Any 3D tracking algorithm has to deal with occlusions: multiple targets get so close to each other that the loss of their identities becomes likely, hence potentially affecting the very quality of the data with interrupted trajectories and identity switches.
0 	Here, we present a novel tracking method that addresses the problem of occlusions within large groups of featureless objects by means of three steps: i) it represents each target as a cloud of points in 3D; ii) once a 3D cluster corresponding to an occlusion occurs, it defines a partitioning problem by introducing a cost function that uses both attractive and repulsive spatio-temporal proximity links; iii) it minimizes the cost function through a semi-definite optimization technique specifically designed to cope with the presence of multi-minima landscapes.
0 	The algorithm is designed to work on 3D data regardless of the experimental method used: multi--camera systems, lidars, radars and RGB-D systems.
0 	By performing tests on public data-sets, we show that the new algorithm produces a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art tracking methods, both by reducing the number of identity switches and by increasing the accuracy of the estimated positions of the targets in real space.

0 	Most of the existing works focused on classifying very clear natural images, evidenced by the widely used image databases such as Caltech-256, PASCAL VOCs and ImageNet.
0 	However, in many real applications, the acquired images may contain certain degradations that lead to various kinds of blurring, noise, and distortions.
0 	One important and interesting problem is the effect of such degradations to the performance of CNN-based image classification and whether degradation removal helps CNN-based image classification.
0 	More specifically, we wonder whether image classification performance drops with each kind of degradation, whether this drop can be avoided by including degraded images into training, and whether existing computer vision algorithms that attempt to remove such degradations can help improve the image classification performance.
0 	In this paper, we empirically study those problems for nine kinds of degraded images - hazy images, motion-blurred images, fish-eye images, underwater images, low resolution images, salt-and-peppered images, images with white Gaussian noise, Gaussian-blurred images and out-of-focus images.

0 	We propose a novel approach to infer a high-quality depth map from a set of images with small viewpoint variations.
0 	In general, techniques for depth estimation from small motion consist of camera pose estimation and dense reconstruction.
0 	In contrast to prior approaches that recover scene geometry and camera motions using pre-calibrated cameras, we introduce a self-calibrating bundle adjustment method tailored for small motion which enables computation of camera poses without the need for camera calibration.
0 	For dense depth reconstruction, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches.
0 	Rather than directly estimating depth or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume, and regressing the depth map from the cost volume.

#### Sequence-to-Segments Networks for Detecting Segments in Videos
0 	Detecting segments of interest from videos is a common problem for many applications.
0 	And yet it is a challenging problem as it often requires not only knowledge of individual target segments, but also contextual understanding of the entire video and the relationships between the target segments.
0 	To address this problem, we propose the Sequence-to-Segments Network (S2N), a novel and general end-to-end sequential encoder-decoder architecture.
0 	S2N first encodes the input video into a sequence of hidden states that capture information progressively, as it appears in the video.
0 	It then employs the Segment Detection Unit (SDU), a novel decoding architecture, that sequentially detects segments.
0 	At each decoding step, the SDU integrates the decoder state and encoder hidden states to detect a target segment.
0 	During training, we address the problem of finding the best assignment of predicted segments to ground truth using the Hungarian Matching Algorithm with Lexicographic Cost.
0 	Additionally, we propose to use the squared Earth Mover's Distance to optimize the localization errors of the segments.
0 	We show the state-of-the-art performance of S2N across numerous tasks, including video highlighting, video summarization, and human action proposal generation.

#### Topology-Aware Non-Rigid Point Cloud Registration
0 	In this paper, we introduce a non-rigid registration pipeline for unorganized point clouds that may be topologically different.
0 	Standard warp field estimation algorithms, even under robust, discontinuity-preserving regularization, produce erratic motion estimates on boundaries associated with ‘close-to-open’ topology changes.
0 	We overcome this limitation by exploiting backward motion: in the opposite direction, a ‘close-to-open’ event becomes ‘open-to-close’, which is by default handled correctly.
0 	Our approach relies on a general, topology-agnostic warp field estimation algorithm, similar to those employed in recent dynamic reconstruction systems from RGB-D input.
0 	We improve motion estimation on boundaries associated with topology changes in an efficient post-processing phase.
0 	Based on both forward and (inverted) backward warp hypotheses, we explicitly detect regions of the deformed geometry that undergo topological changes by means of local deformation criteria and broadly classify them as ‘contacts’ or ‘separations’.
0 	Subsequently, the two motion hypotheses are seamlessly blended on a local basis, according to the type and proximity of detected events.
0 	Our method achieves state-of-the-art motion estimation accuracy on the MPI Sintel dataset.

#### MTFH: A Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing Framework for Efficient Cross-Modal Retrieval
0 	Hashing has recently sparked a great revolution in cross-modal retrieval because of its low storage cost and high query speed.
0 	Recent cross-modal hashing methods often learn unified or equal-length hash codes to represent the multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable.
0 	However, such representations could inherently sacrifice their representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not have one-to-one correspondence and could be encoded more efficiently by different hash codes of unequal lengths.
0 	To mitigate these problems, this paper exploits a related and relatively unexplored problem: encode the heterogeneous data with varying hash lengths and generalize the cross-modal retrieval in various challenging scenarios.
0 	To this end, a generalized and flexible cross-modal hashing framework, termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH), is proposed to work seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired multi-modal data, and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios.
0 	MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to flexibly learn modality-specific hash codes with different length settings, while synchronously learning two semantic correlation matrices for heterogeneous data comparable.
0 	As a result, the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks.
0 	Extensive experiments evaluated on public benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of MTFH under various retrieval scenarios and show its competitive performance with the state-of-the-arts.

0 	Part-level features offers fine granularity for pedestrian image description.
0 	In this article, we generally aim to learn discriminative part-informed features for person re-identification.
0 	Our contribution is two-fold.
0 	First, we introduce a general part-level feature learning method, named Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB).
0 	Given an image, it outputs a convolutional descriptor consisting of several part-level features.
0 	PCB is general in that it is able to accommodate several part partitioning strategies.
0 	In experiment, we show that the learned descriptor maintains a significantly higher discriminative ability than the global descriptor.
0 	Second, Based on PCB, we propose refined part pooling (RPP) to improve the original partition.
0 	Our idea is that pixels within a well-located part should be similar to each other while being dissimilar with pixels from other parts.
0 	We call it within-part consistency.
0 	When a pixel-wise feature vector in a part is more similar to some other part, it is then an outlier, indicating inappropriate partitioning.
0 	RPP re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in refined parts with enhanced within-part consistency.
0 	Experiment confirms that RPP gains another round of performance boost over PCB.
0 	For instance, on the Market-1501 dataset, we achieve (77.4+4.2)% mAP and (92.3+1.5)% rank-1 accuracy, a competitive performance with the state of the art.

0 	To tackle this problem, we propose discriminative pooling, based on the notion that among the features generated on all short clips, there is at least one that characterizes the action.

#### Sparse Coding of Shape Trajectories for Facial Expression and Action Recognition
0 	The detection and tracking of human landmarks in video streams has gained in reliability partly due to the availability of affordable RGB-D sensors.

#### SafePredict: A Meta-Algorithm for Machine Learning That Uses Refusals to Guarantee Correctness
0 	SafePredict is a novel meta-algorithm that works with any base prediction algorithm for online data to guarantee an arbitrarily chosen correctness rate, $1-\in$, by allowing refusals.

0 	When the base predictor happens not to exceed the target error rate $\in$, SafePredict refuses only a finite number of times.
0 	When the error rate of the base predictor changes through time SafePredict makes use of a weight-shifting heuristic that adapts to these changes without knowing when the changes occur yet still maintains the correctness guarantee.

#### Learning with privileged information via adversarial discriminative modality distillation
0 	Heterogeneous data modalities can provide complementary cues for several tasks, usually leading to more robust algorithms and better performance.
0 	However, while training data can be accurately collected to include a variety of sensory modalities, it is often the case that not all of them are available in real life (testing) scenarios, where a model has to be deployed.
0 	This raises the challenge of how to extract information from multimodal data in the training stage, in a form that can be exploited at test time, considering limitations such as noisy or missing modalities.
0 	This paper presents a new approach in this direction for RGB-D vision tasks, developed within the adversarial learning and privileged information frameworks.
0 	We consider the practical case of learning representations from depth and RGB videos, while relying only on RGB data at test time.
0 	We propose a new approach to train a hallucination network that learns to distill depth information via adversarial learning, resulting in a clean approach without several losses to balance or hyperparameters.

#### Pose-Guided Representation Learning for Person Re-Identification
0 	The large pose variations and misalignment errors exhibited by person images significantly increase the difficulty of person Re-Identification (ReID).
0 	Existing works commonly apply extra operations like pose estimation, part segmentation, etc., to alleviate those issues and improve the robustness of pedestrian representations.
0 	While boosting the ReID accuracy, those operations introduce considerable computational overheads and make the deep models complex and hard to tune.
0 	To chase a more efficient solution, we propose a Part-Guided Representation (PGR) composed of Pose Invariant Feature (PIF) and Local Descriptive Feature (LDF), respectively.
0 	We call PGR "Part-Guided" because it is trained and supervised by local part cues.
0 	Specifically, PIF approximates a pose invariant representation inferred by pose estimation and pose normalization.
0 	LDF focuses on discriminative body parts by approximating a representation learned with body region segmentation.
0 	In this way, extra pose extraction is only introduced during the training stage to supervise the learning of PGR, but is not required during the testing stage for feature extraction.
0 	Extensive comparisons with recent works on five widely used datasets demonstrate the competitive accuracy and efficiency of PGR.

#### On Learning 3D Face Morphable Model from In-the-wild Images
0 	As a classic statistical model of 3D facial shape and albedo, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is widely used in facial analysis, e.g., model fitting, image synthesis.
0 	Conventional 3DMM is learned from a set of well-controlled 2D face images with associated 3D face scans, and represented by two sets of PCA basis functions.
0 	Due to the type and amount of training data, as well as, the linear bases, the representation power of 3DMM can be limited.
0 	To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative framework to learn a nonlinear 3DMM model from a large set of unconstrained face images, without collecting 3D face scans.
0 	Specifically, given a face image as input, a network encoder estimates the projection, illumination, shape and albedo parameters.
0 	Two decoders serve as the nonlinear 3DMM to map from the shape and albedo parameters to the 3D shape and albedo, respectively.
0 	With the projection parameter, lighting, 3D shape, and albedo, a novel analytically-differentiable rendering layer is designed to reconstruct the original input face.
0 	The entire network is end-to-end trainable with only weak supervision.

0 	We propose DoubleFusion, a new real-time system that combines volumetric non-rigid reconstruction with data-driven template fitting to simultaneously reconstruct detailed surface geometry, large non-rigid motion, and the optimized human body shape from a single depth camera.
0 	One of the key contributions of this method is a double-layer representation consisting of a complete parametric body model inside, and a gradually fused detailed surface outside.

0 	To handle this problem, we present a Spatio-Temporal Context Coherence (STCC) constraint and a Global Context Coherence (GCC) constraint to capture the relevant motions and quantify their contributions to the group activity, respectively.
0 	Based on this, we propose a novel Coherence Constrained Graph LSTM (CCG-LSTM) with STCC and GCC to effectively recognize group activity, by modeling the relevant motions of individuals while suppressing the irrelevant motions.
0 	Specifically, to capture the relevant motions, we build the CCG-LSTM with a temporal confidence gate and a spatial confidence gate to control the memory state updating in terms of the temporally previous state and the spatially neighboring states, respectively.
0 	Besides, an attention mechanism is employed to quantify the contribution of a certain motion by measuring the consistency between itself and the whole activity at each time step.

0 	This is a general yet challenging vision-language task since it does not only require the localization of objects, but also the multimodal comprehension of context - visual attributes (e.g., "largest", "baby") and relationships (e.g., "behind") that help to distinguish the referent from other objects, especially those of the same category.

#### Zig-Zag Network for Semantic Segmentation of RGB-D Images
0 	Semantic segmentation of images requires an understanding of appearances of objects and their spatial relationships in scenes.
0 	The fully convolutional network (FCN) has been successfully applied to recognize objects' appearances, which are represented with RGB channels.
0 	Images augmented with depth channels provide more understanding of the geometric information of the scene in an image.
0 	In this paper, we present a multiple-branch neural network to utilize depth information to assist in the semantic segmentation of images.
0 	Our approach splits the image into layers according to the "scene-scale".
0 	We introduce the context-aware receptive field (CARF), which provides better control of the relevant context information of learned features.
0 	Each branch of the network is equipped with CARF to adaptively aggregate the context information of image regions, leading to a more focused domain that is easier to learn.
0 	Furthermore, we propose a new zig-zag architecture to exchange information between the feature maps at different levels, augmented by the CARFs of the backbone network and decoder network.
0 	With the flexible information propagation allowed by our zig-zag network, we enrich the context information of feature maps for the segmentation.

0 	Unlike previous approaches that use known viewpoint labels for training, our method treats the viewpoint labels as latent variables, which are learned in an unsupervised manner during the training using an unaligned object dataset.

0 	Moreover, our pose alignment strategy enables one to obtain view-specific feature representations shared across classes, which is important to maintain high accuracy in both object categorization and pose estimation.
0 	Effectiveness of RotationNet is demonstrated by its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods of 3D object classification on 10- and 40-class ModelNet datasets.
0 	We also show that RotationNet, even trained without known poses, achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on an object pose estimation dataset.

#### One shot segmentation: unifying rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation using elastic regularization
0 	This paper proposes a novel approach for the non-rigid segmentation of deformable objects in image sequences, which is based on one-shot segmentation that unifies rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation using elastic regularization.
0 	The domain of application is the segmentation of a visual object that temporally undergoes a rigid transformation (e.g., affine transformation) and a non-rigid transformation (i.e., contour deformation).
0 	The majority of segmentation approaches to solve this problem are generally based on two steps that run in sequence: a rigid detection, followed by a non-rigid segmentation.
0 	In this paper, we propose a new approach, where both the rigid and non-rigid segmentation are performed in a single shot using a sparse low-dimensional manifold that represents the visual object deformations.
0 	Given the multi-modality of these deformations, the manifold partitions the training data into several patches, where each patch provides a segmentation proposal during the inference process.
0 	These multiple segmentation proposals are merged using the classification results produced by deep belief networks (DBN) that compute the confidence on each segmentation proposal.
0 	Thus, an ensemble of DBN classifiers is used for estimating the final segmentation.
0 	Compared to current methods proposed in the field, our proposed approach is advantageous in four aspects: (i) it is a unified framework to produce rigid and non-rigid segmentations; (ii) it uses an ensemble classification process, which can help the segmentation robustness; (iii) it provides a significant reduction in terms of the number of dimensions of the rigid and non-rigid segmentations search spaces, compared to current approaches that divide these two problems; and (iv) this lower dimensionality of the search space can also reduce the need for large annotated training sets to be used for estimating the DBN models.
0 	Experiments on the problem of left ventricle endocardial segmentation from ultrasound images, and lip segmentation from frontal facial images using the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database, demonstrate the potential of the methodology through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and the ability to reduce the search and training complexities without a significant impact on the segmentation accuracy.

0 	Despite significant progress in object categorization, in recent years, a number of important challenges remain; mainly, ability to learn from limited labeled data and ability to recognize object classes within large, potentially open, set of labels.
0 	Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa.

0 	The tranfer of a neural network (CNN) trained to recognize objects to the task of scene classification is considered.
0 	A Bag-of-Semantics (BoS) representation is first induced, by feeding scene image patches to the object CNN, and representing the scene image by the ensuing bag of posterior class probability vectors (semantic posteriors).
0 	The encoding of the BoS with a Fisher vector (FV) is then studied.
0 	A link is established between the FV of any probabilistic model and the Q-function of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm used to estimate its parameters by maximum likelihood.
0 	This enables 1) imediate derivation of FVs for any model for which an EM algorithm exists, and 2) leveraging efficient implementations from the EM literature for the computation of FVs.
0 	It is then shown that standard FVs, such as those derived from Gaussian or even Dirichelet mixtures, are unsuccessful for the transfer of semantic posteriors, due to the highly non-linear nature of the probability simplex.
0 	The analysis of these FVs shows that significant benefits can ensue by 1) designing FVs in the natural parameter space of the multinomial distribution, and 2) adopting sophisticated probabilistic models of semantic feature covariance.
0 	The combination of these two insights leads to the encoding of the BoS in the natural parameter space of the multinomial, using a vector of Fisher scores derived from a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA).
0 	A network implementation of the MFA Fisher Score (MFA-FS), denoted as the MFAFSNet, is finally proposed to enable end-to-end training.
0 	Experiments with various object CNNs and datasets show that the approach has state-of-the-art transfer performance.
0 	Somewhat surprisingly, the scene classification results are superior to those of a CNN explicitly trained for scene classification, using a large scene dataset (Places).
0 	This suggests that holistic analysis is insufficient for scene classification.
0 	The modeling of local object semantics appears to be at least equally important.

0 	The DART descriptor is applied to four different problems, namely object classification, tracking, detection and feature matching: (1) The DART features are directly employed as local descriptors in a bag-of-words classification framework and testing is carried out on four standard event-based object datasets (N-MNIST, MNIST-DVS, CIFAR10-DVS, NCaltech-101); (2) Extending the classification system, tracking is demonstrated using two key novelties: (i) Statistical bootstrapping is leveraged with online learning for overcoming the low-sample problem during the one-shot learning of the tracker, (ii) Cyclical shifts are induced in the log-polar domain of the DART descriptor to achieve robustness to object scale and rotation variations; (3) To solve the long-term object tracking problem, an object detector is designed using the principle of cluster majority voting.
0 	The detection scheme is then combined with the tracker to result in a high intersection-over-union score with augmented ground truth annotations on the publicly available event camera dataset; (4) Finally, the event context encoded by DART greatly simplifies the feature correspondence problem, especially for spatio-temporal slices far apart in time, which has not been explicitly tackled in the event-based vision domain.

#### Learning Low-Dimensional Temporal Representations with Latent Alignments
0 	Low-dimensional discriminative representations enhance machine learning methods in both performance and complexity.
0 	This has motivated supervised dimensionality reduction (DR), which transforms high-dimensional data into a discriminative subspace.
0 	Most DR methods require data to be i.i.d.
0 	However, in some domains, data naturally appear in sequences, where the observations are temporally correlated.

#### A Functional Representation for Graph Matching
0 	Graph matching is an important and persistent problem in computer vision and pattern recognition for finding node-to-node correspondence between graphs.
0 	However, graph matching that incorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational difficulties.
0 	This paper presents a functional representation for graph matching (FRGM) that aims to provide more geometric insights on the problem and reduce the space and time complexities.
0 	To achieve these goals, we represent each graph by a linear function space equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that has an explicit geometric meaning.
0 	Consequently, the correspondence matrix between graphs can be represented as a linear representation map.
0 	Furthermore, this map can be reformulated as a new parameterization for matching graphs in Euclidean space such that it is consistent with graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations.
0 	This allows us to estimate the correspondence matrix and geometric deformations simultaneously.
0 	We use the representation of edge-attributes rather than the affinity matrix to reduce the space complexity and propose an efficient optimization strategy to reduce the time complexity.
0 	The experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that the FRGM can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

#### Robust RGB-D Face Recognition Using Attribute-Aware Loss
0 	Existing convolutional neural network (CNN) based face recognition algorithms typically learn a discriminative feature mapping, using a loss function that enforces separation of features from different classes and/or aggregation of features within the same class.
0 	However, they may suffer from bias in the training data such as uneven sampling density, because they optimize the adjacency relationship of the learned features without considering the proximity of the underlying faces.
0 	Moreover, since they only use facial images for training, the learned feature mapping may not correctly indicate the relationship of other attributes such as gender and ethnicity, which can be important for some face recognition applications.
0 	In this paper, we propose a new CNN-based face recognition approach that incorporates such attributes into the training process.
0 	Using an attribute-aware loss function that regularizes the feature mapping using attribute proximity, our approach learns more discriminative features that are correlated with the attributes.
0 	We train our face recognition model on a large-scale RGB-D data set with over 100K identities captured under real application conditions.

0 	Since a low-resolution (LR) input patch may correspond to many HR candidate patches, this ambiguity may lead to distorted HR facial details and wrong attributes such as gender reversal and rejuvenation.

#### Subspace Clustering via Good Neighbors
0 	Finding the informative clusters of a high-dimensional dataset is at the core of numerous applications in computer vision, where spectral based subspace clustering algorithm is arguably the most widely-studied methods due to its empirical performance and provable guarantees under various assumptions.
0 	It is well-known that sparsity and connectivity of the affinity graph play important rules for effective subspace clustering.
0 	However, it is difficult to simultaneously optimize both factors due to their conflicting nature, and most existing methods are designed to deal with only one factor.
0 	In this paper, we propose an algorithm to optimize both sparsity and connectivity by finding good neighbors which induce key connections among samples within a subspace.
0 	First, an initial coefficient matrix is generated from the input dataset.
0 	For each sample, we find its good neighbors which not only have large coefficients but are strongly connected to each other.
0 	We reassign the coefficients of good neighbors and eliminate other entries to generate a new coefficient matrix, which can be used by spectral clustering methods.
0 	Experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy with a negligible increase in speed.

#### Learning More Universal Representations for Transfer-Learning
0 	A representation is supposed universal if it encodes any element of the visual world (e.g., objects, scenes) in any configuration (e.g., scale, context).
0 	While not expecting pure universal representations, the goal in the literature is to improve the universality level, starting from a representation with a certain level.
0 	To improve that universality level, one can diversify the source-task, but it requires many additive annotated data that is costly in terms of manual work and possible expertise.
0 	We formalize such a diversification process then propose two methods to improve the universality of CNN representations that limit the need for additive annotated data.
0 	The first relies on human categorization knowledge and the second on re-training using fine-tuning.

#### Learning to Localize Sound Sources in Visual Scenes: Analysis and Applications
0 	Visual events are usually accompanied by sounds in our daily lives.

0 	To investigate its empirical learnability, in this work we first present a novel unsupervised algorithm to address the problem of localizing sound sources in visual scenes.
0 	In order to achieve this goal, a two-stream network structure which handles each modality, with attention mechanism is developed for sound source localization.
0 	The network naturally reveals the localized response in the scene without human annotation.
0 	In addition, a new sound source dataset is developed for performance evaluation.

#### Assessing Transferability from Simulation to Reality for Reinforcement Learning
0 	Learning robot control policies from physics simulations is of great interest to the robotics community as it may render the learning process faster, cheaper, and safer by alleviating the need for expensive real-world experiments.
0 	However, the direct transfer of learned behavior from simulation to reality is a major challenge.
0 	Optimizing a policy on a slightly faulty simulator can easily lead to the maximization of the ‘Simulation Optimization Bias’ (SOB).
0 	In this case, the optimizer exploits modeling errors of the simulator such that the resulting behavior can potentially damage the robot.
0 	We tackle this challenge by applying domain randomization, i.e., randomizing the parameters of the physics simulations during learning.
0 	We propose an algorithm called Simulation-based Policy Optimization with Transferability Assessment (SPOTA) which uses an estimator of the SOB to formulate a stopping criterion for training.
0 	The introduced estimator quantifies the over-fitting to the set of domains experienced while training.

0 	Although our problem can be addressed by applying methods from other video interpolation or extrapolation tasks, doing so fails to leverage the additional context information that our problem provides.
0 	To this end, we devise a method specifically designed for video frame inpainting that is composed of two modules: a bidirectional video prediction module and a temporally-aware frame interpolation module.

#### SpaRTA Tracking across occlusions via partitioning of 3D clouds of points
0 	Any 3D tracking algorithm has to deal with occlusions: multiple targets get so close to each other that the loss of their identities becomes likely, hence potentially affecting the very quality of the data with interrupted trajectories and identity switches.
0 	Here, we present a novel tracking method that addresses the problem of occlusions within large groups of featureless objects by means of three steps: i) it represents each target as a cloud of points in 3D; ii) once a 3D cluster corresponding to an occlusion occurs, it defines a partitioning problem by introducing a cost function that uses both attractive and repulsive spatio-temporal proximity links; iii) it minimizes the cost function through a semi-definite optimization technique specifically designed to cope with the presence of multi-minima landscapes.
0 	The algorithm is designed to work on 3D data regardless of the experimental method used: multi--camera systems, lidars, radars and RGB-D systems.
0 	By performing tests on public data-sets, we show that the new algorithm produces a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art tracking methods, both by reducing the number of identity switches and by increasing the accuracy of the estimated positions of the targets in real space.

0 	In contrast to most existing approaches, we do not fuse depth measurements in a volume but in a dense surfel cloud.
0 	We asynchronously (re)triangulate the smoothed surfels to reconstruct a surface mesh.
0 	This novel approach enables to maintain a dense surface representation of the scene during SLAM which can quickly adapt to loop closures.
0 	This is possible by deforming the surfel cloud and asynchronously remeshing the surface where necessary.
0 	The surfel-based representation also naturally supports strongly varying scan resolution.
0 	In particular, it reconstructs colors at the input camera's resolution.
0 	Moreover, in contrast to many volumetric approaches, ours can reconstruct thin objects since objects do not need to enclose a volume.
0 	We demonstrate our approach in a number of experiments, showing that it produces reconstructions that are competitive with the state-of-the-art, and we discuss its advantages and limitations.

0 	We propose a novel approach to infer a high-quality depth map from a set of images with small viewpoint variations.
0 	In general, techniques for depth estimation from small motion consist of camera pose estimation and dense reconstruction.
0 	In contrast to prior approaches that recover scene geometry and camera motions using pre-calibrated cameras, we introduce a self-calibrating bundle adjustment method tailored for small motion which enables computation of camera poses without the need for camera calibration.
0 	For dense depth reconstruction, we present a convolutional neural network called DPSNet (Deep Plane Sweep Network) whose design is inspired by best practices of traditional geometry-based approaches.
0 	Rather than directly estimating depth or optical flow correspondence from image pairs as done in many previous deep learning methods, DPSNet takes a plane sweep approach that involves building a cost volume from deep features using the plane sweep algorithm, regularizing the cost volume, and regressing the depth map from the cost volume.
0 	The cost volume is constructed using a differentiable warping process that allows for end-to-end training of the network.

#### Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Depth Prediction from Images
0 	State-of-the-art methods to infer dense and accurate depth measurements from images rely on deep CNN models trained in an end-to-end fashion on a significant amount of data.
0 	However, despite the outstanding performance achieved, these frameworks suffer a drastic drop in accuracy when dealing with unseen environments much different, concerning appearance (e.g., synthetic vs. real) or context (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor), from those observed during the training phase.
0 	Such domain shift issue is usually softened by fine-tuning on smaller sets of images with depth labels acquired in the target domain with active sensors (e.g., LiDAR).
0 	However, relying on such supervised labeled data is seldom feasible in practical applications.

0 	Detecting segments of interest from videos is a common problem for many applications.
0 	And yet it is a challenging problem as it often requires not only knowledge of individual target segments, but also contextual understanding of the entire video and the relationships between the target segments.
0 	To address this problem, we propose the Sequence-to-Segments Network (S2N), a novel and general end-to-end sequential encoder-decoder architecture.

0 	In this paper, we introduce a non-rigid registration pipeline for unorganized point clouds that may be topologically different.
0 	Standard warp field estimation algorithms, even under robust, discontinuity-preserving regularization, produce erratic motion estimates on boundaries associated with ‘close-to-open’ topology changes.
0 	We overcome this limitation by exploiting backward motion: in the opposite direction, a ‘close-to-open’ event becomes ‘open-to-close’, which is by default handled correctly.

#### MTFH: A Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing Framework for Efficient Cross-Modal Retrieval
0 	Hashing has recently sparked a great revolution in cross-modal retrieval because of its low storage cost and high query speed.
0 	Recent cross-modal hashing methods often learn unified or equal-length hash codes to represent the multi-modal data and make them intuitively comparable.
0 	However, such representations could inherently sacrifice their representation scalability because the data from different modalities may not have one-to-one correspondence and could be encoded more efficiently by different hash codes of unequal lengths.
0 	To mitigate these problems, this paper exploits a related and relatively unexplored problem: encode the heterogeneous data with varying hash lengths and generalize the cross-modal retrieval in various challenging scenarios.
0 	To this end, a generalized and flexible cross-modal hashing framework, termed Matrix Tri-Factorization Hashing (MTFH), is proposed to work seamlessly in various settings including paired or unpaired multi-modal data, and equal or varying hash length encoding scenarios.
0 	MTFH exploits an efficient objective function to flexibly learn modality-specific hash codes with different length settings, while synchronously learning two semantic correlation matrices for heterogeneous data comparable.
0 	As a result, the derived hash codes are more semantically meaningful for various challenging cross-modal retrieval tasks.

0 	Our contribution is two-fold.
0 	First, we introduce a general part-level feature learning method, named Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB).
0 	Given an image, it outputs a convolutional descriptor consisting of several part-level features.
0 	PCB is general in that it is able to accommodate several part partitioning strategies.
0 	In experiment, we show that the learned descriptor maintains a significantly higher discriminative ability than the global descriptor.
0 	Second, Based on PCB, we propose refined part pooling (RPP) to improve the original partition.
0 	Our idea is that pixels within a well-located part should be similar to each other while being dissimilar with pixels from other parts.
0 	We call it within-part consistency.
0 	When a pixel-wise feature vector in a part is more similar to some other part, it is then an outlier, indicating inappropriate partitioning.
0 	RPP re-assigns these outliers to the parts they are closest to, resulting in refined parts with enhanced within-part consistency.
0 	Experiment confirms that RPP gains another round of performance boost over PCB.

0 	This paper proposes an end-to-end fine-grained visual categorization system, termed Part-based Convolutional Neural Network (P-CNN), which consists of three modules.

#### Parallel and Scalable Heat Methods for Geodesic Distance Computation
0 	In this paper, we propose a parallel and scalable approach for geodesic distance computation on triangle meshes.
0 	Our key observation is that the recovery of geodesic distance in the heat method can be reformulated as an optimization of its gradients subject to integrability, which can be solved using an efficient fixed-order method that requires no linear system solving and converges quickly.
0 	Afterwards, the geodesic distance is efficiently recovered by parallel integration of the optimized gradients in breadth-first order.
0 	Moreover, we employ a similar breadth-first strategy to derive a parallel Gauss-Seidel solver for the diffusion step in the heat method.

#### OpenPose: Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields
0 	Realtime multi-person 2D pose estimation is a key component in enabling machines to have an understanding of people in images and videos.
0 	In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image.
0 	The proposed method uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image.
0 	This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image.
0 	In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages.
0 	We demonstrate that using a PAF-only refinement is able to achieve a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy.
0 	We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released.
0 	We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually.
0 	This work has culminated in the release of OpenPose, the first open-source realtime system for multi-person 2D pose detection, including body, foot, hand, and facial keypoints.

#### 3D Rigid Motion Segmentation with Mixed and Unknown Number of Models
0 	Many real-world video sequences cannot be conveniently categorized as general or degenerate; in such cases, imposing a false dichotomy in using the fundamental matrix or homography model for motion segmentation on video sequences would lead to difficulty.
0 	Even when we are confronted with a general scene-motion, the fundamental matrix approach as a model for motion segmentation still suffers from several defects, which we discuss in this paper.
0 	The full potential of the fundamental matrix approach could only be realized if we judiciously harness information from the simpler homography model.
0 	From these considerations, we propose a multi-model spectral clustering framework that synergistically combines multiple models (homography and fundamental matrix) together.
0 	We show that the performance can be substantially improved in this way.
0 	For general motion segmentation tasks, the number of independently moving objects is often unknown a priori and needs to be estimated from the observations.
0 	This is referred to as model selection and it is essentially still an open research problem.
0 	In this work, we propose a set of model selection criteria balancing data fidelity and model complexity.
0 	We perform extensive testing on existing motion segmentation datasets with both segmentation and model selection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on all of them; we also put forth a more realistic and challenging dataset adapted from the KITTI benchmark, containing real-world effects such as strong perspectives and strong forward translations not seen in the traditional datasets.

#### Learning with privileged information via adversarial discriminative modality distillation
0 	Heterogeneous data modalities can provide complementary cues for several tasks, usually leading to more robust algorithms and better performance.
0 	However, while training data can be accurately collected to include a variety of sensory modalities, it is often the case that not all of them are available in real life (testing) scenarios, where a model has to be deployed.
0 	This raises the challenge of how to extract information from multimodal data in the training stage, in a form that can be exploited at test time, considering limitations such as noisy or missing modalities.
0 	This paper presents a new approach in this direction for RGB-D vision tasks, developed within the adversarial learning and privileged information frameworks.
0 	We consider the practical case of learning representations from depth and RGB videos, while relying only on RGB data at test time.
0 	We propose a new approach to train a hallucination network that learns to distill depth information via adversarial learning, resulting in a clean approach without several losses to balance or hyperparameters.

#### Pose-Guided Representation Learning for Person Re-Identification
0 	The large pose variations and misalignment errors exhibited by person images significantly increase the difficulty of person Re-Identification (ReID).
0 	Existing works commonly apply extra operations like pose estimation, part segmentation, etc., to alleviate those issues and improve the robustness of pedestrian representations.
0 	While boosting the ReID accuracy, those operations introduce considerable computational overheads and make the deep models complex and hard to tune.
0 	To chase a more efficient solution, we propose a Part-Guided Representation (PGR) composed of Pose Invariant Feature (PIF) and Local Descriptive Feature (LDF), respectively.
0 	We call PGR "Part-Guided" because it is trained and supervised by local part cues.
0 	Specifically, PIF approximates a pose invariant representation inferred by pose estimation and pose normalization.
0 	LDF focuses on discriminative body parts by approximating a representation learned with body region segmentation.
0 	In this way, extra pose extraction is only introduced during the training stage to supervise the learning of PGR, but is not required during the testing stage for feature extraction.
0 	Extensive comparisons with recent works on five widely used datasets demonstrate the competitive accuracy and efficiency of PGR.

0 	We give a unified presentation of the surrogate-based formulations that incorporate the features of rectification and alignment simultaneously, and establish worst-case error bounds of the recovered tensor.

#### On Learning 3D Face Morphable Model from In-the-wild Images
0 	As a classic statistical model of 3D facial shape and albedo, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) is widely used in facial analysis, e.g., model fitting, image synthesis.
0 	Conventional 3DMM is learned from a set of well-controlled 2D face images with associated 3D face scans, and represented by two sets of PCA basis functions.
0 	Due to the type and amount of training data, as well as, the linear bases, the representation power of 3DMM can be limited.
0 	To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative framework to learn a nonlinear 3DMM model from a large set of unconstrained face images, without collecting 3D face scans.
0 	Specifically, given a face image as input, a network encoder estimates the projection, illumination, shape and albedo parameters.
0 	Two decoders serve as the nonlinear 3DMM to map from the shape and albedo parameters to the 3D shape and albedo, respectively.
0 	With the projection parameter, lighting, 3D shape, and albedo, a novel analytically-differentiable rendering layer is designed to reconstruct the original input face.
0 	The entire network is end-to-end trainable with only weak supervision.
0 	We demonstrate the superior representation power of our nonlinear 3DMM over its linear counterpart, and its contribution to face alignment and 3D reconstruction.

0 	We propose DoubleFusion, a new real-time system that combines volumetric non-rigid reconstruction with data-driven template fitting to simultaneously reconstruct detailed surface geometry, large non-rigid motion, and the optimized human body shape from a single depth camera.
0 	One of the key contributions of this method is a double-layer representation consisting of a complete parametric body model inside, and a gradually fused detailed surface outside.
0 	A pre-defined node graph on the body parameterizes the non-rigid deformations near the body, and a free-form dynamically changing graph parameterizes the outer surface layer far from the body, which allows more general reconstruction.
0 	We further propose a joint motion tracking method based on the double-layer representation to enable robust and fast motion tracking performance.
0 	Moreover, the inner parametric body is optimized online and forced to fit inside the outer surface layer as well as the live depth input.

#### Coherence Constrained Graph LSTM for Group Activity Recognition
0 	This work aims to address the group activity recognition problem by exploring human motion characteristics.
0 	Traditional methods hold that the motions of all persons contribute equally to the group activity, which suppresses the contributions of some relevant motions to the whole activity while overstates some irrelevant motions.
0 	To handle this problem, we present a Spatio-Temporal Context Coherence (STCC) constraint and a Global Context Coherence (GCC) constraint to capture the relevant motions and quantify their contributions to the group activity, respectively.
0 	Based on this, we propose a novel Coherence Constrained Graph LSTM (CCG-LSTM) with STCC and GCC to effectively recognize group activity, by modeling the relevant motions of individuals while suppressing the irrelevant motions.
0 	Specifically, to capture the relevant motions, we build the CCG-LSTM with a temporal confidence gate and a spatial confidence gate to control the memory state updating in terms of the temporally previous state and the spatially neighboring states, respectively.
0 	Besides, an attention mechanism is employed to quantify the contribution of a certain motion by measuring the consistency between itself and the whole activity at each time step.

0 	In this paper, we propose a novel Task-Recursive Learning (TRL) framework to jointly and recurrently conduct three representative tasks therein containing depth estimation, surface normal prediction and semantic segmentation.
0 	TRL recursively refines the prediction results through a series of task-level interactions, where one-time cross-task interaction is abstracted as one network block of one time stage.
0 	In each stage, we serialize multiple tasks into a sequence and then recursively perform their interactions.
0 	To adaptively enhance counterpart patterns, we encapsulate interactions into a specific Task-Attentional Module (TAM) to mutually-boost the tasks from each other.
0 	Across stages, the historical experiences of previous states of tasks are selectively propagated into the next stages by using Feature-Selection unit (FS-Unit), which takes advantage of complementary information across tasks.

0 	This is a general yet challenging vision-language task since it does not only require the localization of objects, but also the multimodal comprehension of context - visual attributes (e.g., "largest", "baby") and relationships (e.g., "behind") that help to distinguish the referent from other objects, especially those of the same category.

0 	Objective quality assessment (OQA) of image retargeting results is often desired to automatically select the best results.
0 	Existing OQA methods train a model using some benchmarks (e.g., RetargetMe), in which subjective scores evaluated by users are provided.
0 	Observing that it is challenging even for human subjects to give consistent scores for retargeting results of different source images (diff-source-results), in this paper we propose a learning-based OQA method that trains a General Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model based on relative scores --- which preserve the ranking --- of retargeting results of the same source image (same-source-results).
0 	In particular, we develop a novel training scheme with provable convergence that learns a common base scalar for same-source-results.
0 	With this source specific offset, our computed scores not only preserve the ranking of subjective scores for same-source-results, but also provide a reference to compare the diff-source-results.
0 	We train and evaluate our GRNN model using human preference data collected in RetargetMe.
0 	Moreover, we introduce a further subjective benchmark to evaluate the generalizability of different OQA methods.
0 	Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms ten representative OQA methods in ranking prediction.

#### Bayesian Low-Tubal-Rank Robust Tensor Factorization with Multi-Rank Determination
0 	Robust tensor factorization is a fundamental problem in machine learning and computer vision, which aims at recovering tensors corrupted with outliers as a sum of the low-rank and sparse components.
0 	However, existing methods either suffer from limited modeling power in preserving low-rank structures, or have difficulties in determining the target tensor rank and the trade-off between the low-rank and sparse components.
0 	To address these problems, we propose a fully Bayesian treatment of robust tensor factorization along with a generalized sparsity-inducing prior.
0 	By adapting the recently proposed low-tubal-rank model in a generative manner, our method is effective in preserving low-rank structures.
0 	Moreover, benefiting from the proposed prior and the Bayesian framework, the proposed method can automatically determine the tensor rank while inferring the trade-off between the low-rank and sparse components.
0 	For model estimation, we develop a variational inference algorithm, and further improve its efficiency by reformulating the variational updates in the frequency domain.
0 	Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in multi-rank determination as well as its superiority in image denoising and background modeling over state-of-the-art approaches.

#### Zig-Zag Network for Semantic Segmentation of RGB-D Images
0 	Semantic segmentation of images requires an understanding of appearances of objects and their spatial relationships in scenes.
0 	The fully convolutional network (FCN) has been successfully applied to recognize objects' appearances, which are represented with RGB channels.
0 	Images augmented with depth channels provide more understanding of the geometric information of the scene in an image.
0 	In this paper, we present a multiple-branch neural network to utilize depth information to assist in the semantic segmentation of images.
0 	Our approach splits the image into layers according to the "scene-scale".
0 	We introduce the context-aware receptive field (CARF), which provides better control of the relevant context information of learned features.
0 	Each branch of the network is equipped with CARF to adaptively aggregate the context information of image regions, leading to a more focused domain that is easier to learn.
0 	Furthermore, we propose a new zig-zag architecture to exchange information between the feature maps at different levels, augmented by the CARFs of the backbone network and decoder network.
0 	With the flexible information propagation allowed by our zig-zag network, we enrich the context information of feature maps for the segmentation.

#### RotationNet for Joint Object Categorization and Unsupervised Pose Estimation from Multi-view Images
0 	We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model "RotationNet," which takes multi-view images of an object as input and jointly estimates its pose and object category.
0 	Unlike previous approaches that use known viewpoint labels for training, our method treats the viewpoint labels as latent variables, which are learned in an unsupervised manner during the training using an unaligned object dataset.
0 	RotationNet uses only a partial set of multi-view images for inference, and this property makes it useful in practical scenarios where only partial views are available.
0 	Moreover, our pose alignment strategy enables one to obtain view-specific feature representations shared across classes, which is important to maintain high accuracy in both object categorization and pose estimation.
0 	Effectiveness of RotationNet is demonstrated by its superior performance to the state-of-the-art methods of 3D object classification on 10- and 40-class ModelNet datasets.
0 	We also show that RotationNet, even trained without known poses, achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on an object pose estimation dataset.
0 	Furthermore, our object ranking method based on classification by RotationNet achieved the first prize in two tracks of the 3D Shape Retrieval Contest (SHREC) 2017.

#### One shot segmentation: unifying rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation using elastic regularization
0 	This paper proposes a novel approach for the non-rigid segmentation of deformable objects in image sequences, which is based on one-shot segmentation that unifies rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation using elastic regularization.
0 	The domain of application is the segmentation of a visual object that temporally undergoes a rigid transformation (e.g., affine transformation) and a non-rigid transformation (i.e., contour deformation).
0 	The majority of segmentation approaches to solve this problem are generally based on two steps that run in sequence: a rigid detection, followed by a non-rigid segmentation.
0 	In this paper, we propose a new approach, where both the rigid and non-rigid segmentation are performed in a single shot using a sparse low-dimensional manifold that represents the visual object deformations.
0 	Given the multi-modality of these deformations, the manifold partitions the training data into several patches, where each patch provides a segmentation proposal during the inference process.
0 	These multiple segmentation proposals are merged using the classification results produced by deep belief networks (DBN) that compute the confidence on each segmentation proposal.
0 	Thus, an ensemble of DBN classifiers is used for estimating the final segmentation.
0 	Compared to current methods proposed in the field, our proposed approach is advantageous in four aspects: (i) it is a unified framework to produce rigid and non-rigid segmentations; (ii) it uses an ensemble classification process, which can help the segmentation robustness; (iii) it provides a significant reduction in terms of the number of dimensions of the rigid and non-rigid segmentations search spaces, compared to current approaches that divide these two problems; and (iv) this lower dimensionality of the search space can also reduce the need for large annotated training sets to be used for estimating the DBN models.
0 	Experiments on the problem of left ventricle endocardial segmentation from ultrasound images, and lip segmentation from frontal facial images using the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database, demonstrate the potential of the methodology through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and the ability to reduce the search and training complexities without a significant impact on the segmentation accuracy.

#### Vocabulary-informed Zero-shot and Open-set Learning
0 	Despite significant progress in object categorization, in recent years, a number of important challenges remain; mainly, ability to learn from limited labeled data and ability to recognize object classes within large, potentially open, set of labels.
0 	Zero-shot learning is one way of addressing these challenges, but it has only been shown to work with limited sized class vocabularies and typically requires separation between supervised and unsupervised classes, allowing former to inform the latter but not vice versa.

0 	Recent advances in object detection heavily depend on the off-the-shelf models pre-trained on large-scale classification datasets like ImageNet and OpenImage.
0 	However, one problem is that adopting pre-trained models from classification to detection task may incur learning bias due to the different objective function and diverse distributions of object categories.
0 	Techniques like fine-tuning on detection task could alleviate this issue to some extent but are still not fundamental.
0 	Furthermore, transferring these pre-trained models cross discrepant domains will be more difficult (e.g., from RGB to depth images).
0 	Thus, a better solution to handle these critical problems is to train object detectors from scratch, which motivates our proposed method.
0 	In DSOD, we contribute a set of design principles for learning object detectors from scratch.
0 	One of the key principles is the deep supervision, enabled by layer-wise dense connections in both backbone networks and prediction layers, plays a critical role in learning good detectors from scratch.

0 	The tranfer of a neural network (CNN) trained to recognize objects to the task of scene classification is considered.
0 	A Bag-of-Semantics (BoS) representation is first induced, by feeding scene image patches to the object CNN, and representing the scene image by the ensuing bag of posterior class probability vectors (semantic posteriors).
0 	The encoding of the BoS with a Fisher vector (FV) is then studied.
0 	A link is established between the FV of any probabilistic model and the Q-function of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm used to estimate its parameters by maximum likelihood.
0 	This enables 1) imediate derivation of FVs for any model for which an EM algorithm exists, and 2) leveraging efficient implementations from the EM literature for the computation of FVs.
0 	It is then shown that standard FVs, such as those derived from Gaussian or even Dirichelet mixtures, are unsuccessful for the transfer of semantic posteriors, due to the highly non-linear nature of the probability simplex.
0 	The analysis of these FVs shows that significant benefits can ensue by 1) designing FVs in the natural parameter space of the multinomial distribution, and 2) adopting sophisticated probabilistic models of semantic feature covariance.
0 	The combination of these two insights leads to the encoding of the BoS in the natural parameter space of the multinomial, using a vector of Fisher scores derived from a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA).
0 	A network implementation of the MFA Fisher Score (MFA-FS), denoted as the MFAFSNet, is finally proposed to enable end-to-end training.
0 	Experiments with various object CNNs and datasets show that the approach has state-of-the-art transfer performance.
0 	Somewhat surprisingly, the scene classification results are superior to those of a CNN explicitly trained for scene classification, using a large scene dataset (Places).
0 	This suggests that holistic analysis is insufficient for scene classification.
0 	The modeling of local object semantics appears to be at least equally important.
0 	The two approaches are also shown to be strongly complementary, leading to very large scene classification gains when combined, and outperforming all previous scene classification approaches by a sizeable margin.

#### Direction-aware Spatial Context Features for Shadow Detection and Removal
0 	Shadow detection and shadow removal are fundamental and challenging tasks, requiring an understanding of the global image semantics.
0 	This paper presents a novel deep neural network design for shadow detection and removal by analyzing the spatial image context in a direction-aware manner.
0 	To achieve this, we first formulate the direction-aware attention mechanism in a spatial recurrent neural network (RNN) by introducing attention weights when aggregating spatial context features in the RNN.
0 	By learning these weights through training, we can recover direction-aware spatial context (DSC) for detecting and removing shadows.
0 	This design is developed into the DSC module and embedded in a convolutional neural network to learn the DSC features at different levels.
0 	Moreover, we design a weighted cross entropy loss to make effective the training for shadow detection and further adopt the network for shadow removal by using a Euclidean loss function and formulating a color transfer function to address the color and luminosity inconsistencies in the training pairs.
0 	We employed two shadow detection benchmark datasets and two shadow removal benchmark datasets, and performed various experiments to evaluate our method.
0 	Experimental results show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods for both shadow detection and shadow removal.

#### DART: Distribution Aware Retinal Transform for Event-based Cameras
0 	We introduce a generic visual descriptor, termed as distribution aware retinal transform (DART), that encodes the structural context using log-polar grids for event cameras.
0 	The DART descriptor is applied to four different problems, namely object classification, tracking, detection and feature matching: (1) The DART features are directly employed as local descriptors in a bag-of-words classification framework and testing is carried out on four standard event-based object datasets (N-MNIST, MNIST-DVS, CIFAR10-DVS, NCaltech-101); (2) Extending the classification system, tracking is demonstrated using two key novelties: (i) Statistical bootstrapping is leveraged with online learning for overcoming the low-sample problem during the one-shot learning of the tracker, (ii) Cyclical shifts are induced in the log-polar domain of the DART descriptor to achieve robustness to object scale and rotation variations; (3) To solve the long-term object tracking problem, an object detector is designed using the principle of cluster majority voting.
0 	The detection scheme is then combined with the tracker to result in a high intersection-over-union score with augmented ground truth annotations on the publicly available event camera dataset; (4) Finally, the event context encoded by DART greatly simplifies the feature correspondence problem, especially for spatio-temporal slices far apart in time, which has not been explicitly tackled in the event-based vision domain.

#### A Functional Representation for Graph Matching
0 	Graph matching is an important and persistent problem in computer vision and pattern recognition for finding node-to-node correspondence between graphs.
0 	However, graph matching that incorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is NP-complete and results in intrinsic computational difficulties.
0 	This paper presents a functional representation for graph matching (FRGM) that aims to provide more geometric insights on the problem and reduce the space and time complexities.
0 	To achieve these goals, we represent each graph by a linear function space equipped with a functional such as inner product or metric, that has an explicit geometric meaning.
0 	Consequently, the correspondence matrix between graphs can be represented as a linear representation map.
0 	Furthermore, this map can be reformulated as a new parameterization for matching graphs in Euclidean space such that it is consistent with graphs under rigid or nonrigid deformations.
0 	This allows us to estimate the correspondence matrix and geometric deformations simultaneously.
0 	We use the representation of edge-attributes rather than the affinity matrix to reduce the space complexity and propose an efficient optimization strategy to reduce the time complexity.

#### Robust RGB-D Face Recognition Using Attribute-Aware Loss
0 	Existing convolutional neural network (CNN) based face recognition algorithms typically learn a discriminative feature mapping, using a loss function that enforces separation of features from different classes and/or aggregation of features within the same class.
0 	However, they may suffer from bias in the training data such as uneven sampling density, because they optimize the adjacency relationship of the learned features without considering the proximity of the underlying faces.
0 	Moreover, since they only use facial images for training, the learned feature mapping may not correctly indicate the relationship of other attributes such as gender and ethnicity, which can be important for some face recognition applications.

0 	We evaluate our method on a large set of synthesized non-frontal face images to assess its reconstruction performance.
0 	Extensive experiments demonstrate that TANN generates both qualitatively and quantitatively superior results achieving over 4 dB improvement over the state-of-the-art.

#### Defining Image Memorability using the Visual Memory Schema
0 	Memorability of an image is a characteristic determined by the human observers' ability to remember images they have seen.
0 	Yet recent work on image memorability defines it as an intrinsic property that can be obtained independent of the observer.
0 	The current study aims to enhance our understanding and prediction of image memorability, improving upon existing approaches by incorporating the properties of cumulative human annotations.
0 	We propose a new concept called the Visual Memory Schema (VMS) referring to an organization of image components human observers share when encoding and recognizing images.
0 	The concept of VMS is operationalised by asking human observers to define memorable regions of images they were asked to remember during an episodic memory test.
0 	We then statistically assess the consistency of VMSs across observers for either correctly or incorrectly recognised images.
0 	The associations of the VMSs with eye fixations and saliency are analysed separately as well.
0 	Lastly, we adapt various deep learning architectures for the reconstruction and prediction of memorable regions in images and analyse the results when using transfer learning at the outputs of different convolutional network layers.

#### The Gap of Semantic Parsing: A Survey on Automatic Math Word Problem Solvers
0 	Solving mathematical word problems (MWPs) automatically is challenging, primarily due to the semantic gap between human-readable words and machine-understandable logics.
0 	Despite the long history dated back to the $1960$s, MWPs have regained intensive attention in the past few years with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI).
0 	Solving MWPs successfully is considered as a milestone towards general AI.
0 	Many systems have claimed promising results in self-crafted and small-scale datasets.
0 	However, when applied on large and diverse datasets, none of the proposed methods in the literature achieves high precision, revealing that current MWP solvers still have much room for improvement.
0 	This motivated us to present a comprehensive survey to deliver a clear and complete picture of automatic math problem solvers.
0 	In this survey, we emphasize on algebraic word problems, summarize their extracted features and proposed techniques to bridge the semantic gap, and compare their performance in the publicly accessible datasets.
0 	We also cover automatic solvers for other types of math problems such as geometric problems that require the understanding of diagrams.
0 	Finally, we identify several emerging research directions for the readers with interests in MWPs.

#### Subspace Clustering via Good Neighbors
0 	Finding the informative clusters of a high-dimensional dataset is at the core of numerous applications in computer vision, where spectral based subspace clustering algorithm is arguably the most widely-studied methods due to its empirical performance and provable guarantees under various assumptions.
0 	It is well-known that sparsity and connectivity of the affinity graph play important rules for effective subspace clustering.
0 	However, it is difficult to simultaneously optimize both factors due to their conflicting nature, and most existing methods are designed to deal with only one factor.
0 	In this paper, we propose an algorithm to optimize both sparsity and connectivity by finding good neighbors which induce key connections among samples within a subspace.
0 	First, an initial coefficient matrix is generated from the input dataset.
0 	For each sample, we find its good neighbors which not only have large coefficients but are strongly connected to each other.
0 	We reassign the coefficients of good neighbors and eliminate other entries to generate a new coefficient matrix, which can be used by spectral clustering methods.
0 	Experiments on five benchmark datasets show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy with a negligible increase in speed.

#### Learning More Universal Representations for Transfer-Learning
0 	A representation is supposed universal if it encodes any element of the visual world (e.g., objects, scenes) in any configuration (e.g., scale, context).
0 	While not expecting pure universal representations, the goal in the literature is to improve the universality level, starting from a representation with a certain level.
0 	To improve that universality level, one can diversify the source-task, but it requires many additive annotated data that is costly in terms of manual work and possible expertise.
0 	We formalize such a diversification process then propose two methods to improve the universality of CNN representations that limit the need for additive annotated data.
0 	The first relies on human categorization knowledge and the second on re-training using fine-tuning.
0 	We propose a new aggregating metric to evaluate the universality in a transfer-learning scheme, that addresses more aspects than previous works.
0 	Based on it, we show the interest of our methods on 10 target-problems, relating to classification on a variety of visual domains.
