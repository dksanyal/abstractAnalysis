0	   teaching with a classroom feedback schoolroom system can benefit both teaching and learning practices of interactivity
1	   in this paper we propose a dual channel classroom feedback system integrated with a back end e incorporated learning system
1	   the system consists of and agents running on the students the learning a teaching agent running on computers instructors computer
1	   the learning agent collects both instructional and social responses from the students information processing system and then sends them back to the instructors computer through a two and then channel mechanism
1   the instructional responses are receive by greet the spoken keywords while the social responses are receive by analyzing the social signals provided by students head movements
1   later the teaching agent displays appraise the summarized responses summarise on the teaching dashboard for the instructor to evaluate their teaching practices
2   empirical experiment effect show that the system has an acceptable performance and offer enhanced interactivity in both learning and teaching
2   also further analysis indiana reveals instructor schoolroom that the dual channel mechanism not only provides the basic functions of a classroom feedback system the students responses to the instructors questions but also promotes both students and instructors as well to be engaged and attentive in class
2   as the deuce distribution channel feedback mechanism can be embedded into an e learning system the proposed system is an enhancement of a digital classroom environment
2   in short with the help the two feedback mechanism interactivity on teaching practices and activities can be greatly improved
2   students can then acquire a much often better learning experience and satisfaction

1	   in this paper we develop a framework that combines model driven strategy detection with data driven pattern discovery for analyzing students learning activity data in open ended environments 
2	   we present results from an in depth case study of multiple activity patterns identified in data from the bettys brain learning environment 
2   the results illustrate the benefits of combining model and data driven techniques to precisely characterize the learning behavior of students in an open ended environment

2   neither geezerhood nor gender seemed to affect the outcomes
2	   casual and well rounded gamers scored the game than non gamers and hardcore
1	   due to these results we also explored whether the visibility gaming profile affected traditional educational approaches
2   traditional videogames worked better than videogames only for students who do not usually play education

#### Hybrid Augmented Reality for Participatory Learning: The Hidden Efficacy of Multi-User Game-Based Simulation


0	   the goal of this research is to articulate and test a new hybrid augmented reality ar environment for conceptual understanding 
0	   from the theoretical lens of embodied interaction we have designed a multi user participatory simulation called arfract where visitors in a science museum can learn about complex scientific concepts on the refraction of light through full body immersion using optical see through ar glasses projection based ar and gesture technology 
1	   in particular we developed two different types of simulations for arfract namely a game based simulation and a non game simulation to explore how the order of different ar simulations influences the perceived usability user behaviors learning experiences and learning outcomes 
1	   for the experiment dyads were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions the game to non game condition and the non game to game condition 
2   the results indicate that the learners who experienced the game based simulation before the non game simulation performed better than did the other group with the reversed experience order 
2	   this paper also reports the usability user behaviors and learning experience issues regarding the affordances of hybrid ar technologies 
2   the major contribution of this proof of concept research is that it articulates our understanding of how particular configurations i e order of the emerging technologies i e hybrid augmented reality systems and its use can lead to different learning outcomes

2   additionally in the second experiment we found that neither the nature automatic or interactive nor the quality of the starting point seems to have any effect on the perceived quality of the final projects

0	   due to the size of a domain model manual domain model creation is a challenging and demanding task for teachers or content and metadata authors

#### Item Response Theory for Peer Assessment


0	   as an assessment method based on a constructivist approach peer assessment has become popular in recent years 
0	   however in peer assessment a problem remains that reliability depends on the rater characteristics 
0   for this reason some item response models that incorporate rater parameters have been proposed 
0   those models are expected to improve the reliability if the model parameters can be estimated accurately 
0   however when applying them to actual peer assessment the parameter estimation accuracy would be reduced for the following reasons 
0   the number of rater parameters increases with two or more times the number of raters because the models include higher dimensional rater parameters 
0   the accuracy of parameter estimation from sparse peer assessment data depends strongly on hand tuning parameters called hyperparameters 
1   to solve these problems this article presents a proposal of a new item response model for peer assessment that incorporates rater parameters to maintain as few rater parameters as possible 
1   furthermore this article presents a proposal of a parameter estimation method using a hierarchical bayes model for the proposed model that can learn the hyperparameters from data 
2   finally this article describes the effectiveness of the proposed method using results obtained from a simulation and actual data experiments

2   aless can provide learning guidance when conducting ubiquitous learning activities 
1   a great deal of context information is used in aless including the location the current capacity of the learning object the time available etc 
2   aless is able to actively provide the required learning support to individual students when they approach the corresponding real world learning targets 
1	   to evaluate the performance of aless an experiment was conducted in the national science museum of taiwan 
2   the experimental results showed that with the help of aless the students learned more efficiently and achieved better learning performance
